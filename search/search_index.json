Installation \u00b6 To install Hair Tool you need zip file from your Gumroad account. Then, inside Blender, go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons, and click ' Install ' button. And navigate to hair_tool_3.xy.zip file location. For Blender 3.6 use hair_tool_3.x zip files! Updating \u00b6 Hair Tool has build-in auto updater which will download and install the latest add-on release. To use auto updater go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Hair Tool > press Check for update . If new version is found, press Update addon button, wait few seconds and restart blender. Note: To prevent excessive email notifications and minimize spam, I publish smaller updates and bug fixes without increasing the version number. When enough new features or fixes are implemented, I release a new official version with an increased release number. If you want to get the 'smaller' bugfixes but the addon shows that you already have the latest version, use Reinstall Current Version . This will download the smaller incremental bug fixes.. You can also download updates manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Hair Tool. Checking for new version of Hair Tool from Preferences panel Limitations \u00b6 You can't move vertices in curve Edit Mode, if 'Strands Overlay' is enabled.

Hair Tool give you easy option, to generate bones and weight paint data for your hair cards. You can animate generated bones using simple jiggle physics. Note : This only works on mesh hair (there is no way to rig curves in blender). Bones Setup \u00b6 To create bones for selected mesh strands (islands): convert curve hair to mesh using Curves to Mesh In mesh edit mode select hair strands (mesh islands) that you want to animate. Open Hair Tool Pie menu using Ctrl+Shift+H -> select 'Generate Bones' now you can tweak option for bone generation (bones count, starting position, etc) If you already have armature object assigned to your character it is recommended that you point Hair Tool to it by setting 'Target Rig' property.

Hair System is made from: A setup section to assign a guide curve and source mesh Hair sub-systems with generators and Deformers to create and modify strands A hair profile to add geometry, UVs, and materials to strands Hair Sub-Systems in stack can communicate together with usage of Tags - this help to describe which Hair System is affecting which strands. Hair System is located in Right Sidebar \u2192 Hair Tool Tab \u2192 Hair System Panel. Click [+] to add Hair System to selected mesh or curve object. On image above we have Two Hair Systems named: Parent , Child . You can see Child system is made from: Strand Generator, Noise, Clump, Set Radius etc. deformers. Whole system is guided by: HairCurve guide - second input at very top Strands generated with Hair Systems are then passed to hair profile generation system, which convert these strands to hair-cards. One Minute Hair Setup \u00b6 Below I show you demo of how to setup game ready hair in 1 minute : /run/media/bartosz/8C343C61343C5086/3D blender files/BlenderAddons/HairTool/HT_Site/HairToolDocs_30/docs/img/geo_nodes_hair/hair_workflow_from_zero.mp4 Your browser does not support the video tag. Full setup - starting from scalp mesh, and ending with mesh haircards ready for export Description of steps: Select scalp mesh, and go to Draw Hair Panel > Enable Draw Hair Hold D key, and draw guide curves with LMB (default Hair Material and UVs will be automatically assigned to them) You may need to adjust flat profile width (it was ok above, but it depends on size of your mesh) Add Hair System with Strand Generator option, and go to Hair System Panel. Hair System panel > Deformers > Strand Generator > Bumping up strands density to 22222 (value depends on size of your object) Adding Deformers: Radius Set - it will taper the haircards Noise - it will break the even look of hair Align Tilt - it will force hair cards to face scalp surface Ctrl+Shift+H > Convert Hair to Mesh (or you can use Finalize , to create mesh copy of HSystem) That is it, you can now export generated mesh to Game. If you want, you can restore curve hair object with Ctrl+Shift+H > 'Restore Hair Object' - and continue working on it. Two Minute Hair Setup \u00b6 In video below we make hairstyle with split. /run/media/bartosz/8C343C61343C5086/3D blender files/BlenderAddons/HairTool/HT_Site/HairToolDocs_30/docs/img/geo_nodes_hair/hair_workflow_from_zero.mp4 Your browser does not support the video tag. Full setup - starting from scalp mesh, and ending with mesh haircards ready for export Above we used option of selecting strands by mesh island > see Strand Selection section. Transfer Hair System \u00b6 Hair System can be assigned to Mesh or Curve Hair object, depending on which object is selected when you add Hair System. If you want to change Hair System 'owner' you can use Transfer Hair System operator. Hair System that generates hair-cards (in center above) can be assigned to: Source/Base Mesh mesh from which strands are spawned from (often scalp mesh) Empty Mesh helper, without geometry, usually linked with Source Mesh and Guide Curve Guide Curve curve object that guides strands Empty Curve helper, without geometry, (usually linked with Source Mesh and Guide Curve) Hair system transfer possibilities: Current Owner Transfer To Result Guide Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Guide Curve Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to new, empty mesh object Empty Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Base Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Base Mesh Empty Curve Hair System will be moved to Empty Curve Hair object Base Mesh Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to Empty Mesh object Empty Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Empty Mesh Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Visually, there should not be any noticeable difference. However, the owner of the Hair System will change User cases when you want to use Transfer Hair System: if you want to 'Bake' curves generated by Hair System to curve, but it is assigned to Mesh (meshes cannot receive curves geometry). In that case you can transfer Hair System to Empty Curve, and then bake it to it if hair interpolation is broken (e.g. stops working after you select and try to sculpt Guide Curve. See note in Hair Interpolation section General Operations \u00b6 Remove whole Hair System - removes all Hair Systems, Setup and Profile modifiers from object Update Whole Hair System - updates Setup, Profile, Hair SubSystems (without deformers) nodes. All nodes are recreated from scratch, it is destructive operation and may break your Hair setup! Bake All SubSystems To Curves - Bake curves generated by All Hair sub-Systems into curves geometry. This works only on hair curve type of objects ( try: Ctr+Shift+H > Transfer Hair System: to Empty Curve, or to Guide Curve) Sub-Systems Types \u00b6 After adding a Hair Sub-System, you'll see the first slot in the deformer stack is added automatically. This is determined by the selected hair sub-system type. Strands Generator \u00b6 It will generate strands, from Base Mesh surface, with parameters like: resolution, density, length, interpolation ( Parent Child relation must be set ) etc. These strands are affected by all subsequent deformers in current system stack Your browser does not support the video tag. Set parent Tags and enable interplation option, so that generated strands will follow these Tagged strands. See Child Parent Setup Your browser does not support the video tag. Align to Surface Normal - option changes how the interplation works. Do not confuse with Align Tilt To Source Surface Strands Filter \u00b6 The tool will enable you to make adjustments to existing hair strands. It does not matter if these strands are 'real' - e.g. generated with Hair Drawing , or generated procedurally by preceding Hair subSystem. It offers the option to affect only some of the strands, by filtering them with TAGs . Imagine you want to modify two Hair Systems, by adding Set Radius or Align Tilt . Instead of applying these deformers to each individual Hair subSystem, you can utilize the Filter System to affect all strands simultaneously . Your browser does not support the video tag. Demo of applying 'Scale' deformer to strands generated with Right Tag Note : If no filter tag is specified, then all strands will be affected Strands From Grid Surface \u00b6 This is special type of Generator, that will generate strands from Grid Surface (chessboard like mesh, made of quads with grid topology). Root of strands will be placed: on edge loop marked as Sharp (Ctrl+E -> Mark Sharp) or on crease edge (Shift+E -> Crease Edge). These strands are affected by all subsequent deformers in current system stack Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above - top, boundary edge loop was marked as sharp Note : Notice how guide grid, in video above, has uneven topology - getting dense to the right. This is important when adjusting 'Uniform Spacing' option Note : To mask-out placement of roots, just plugin in vertex group mask into 'Placement Mask' input Child - Parent setup \u00b6 Tags serve as labels that can be used to link two Hair SubSystems , establishing a parent-child relationship (parent strands will guide child strands). Linking two Hair Systems enables capabilities such as: clumping, interpolation, curls, braids, twist and some other possibilities. Your browser does not support the video tag. Above I connected two hair systems using RED tag. 'ParentSys' (colored red ) receives RED tag, and then same tag is applied to 'Child' system ( yellow ) - in [Parent] input. From this point forward, the yellow child strands will follow the red ones Hair Interpolation \u00b6 To enable hair interpolation, current Hair System has to have parent - see above . After that Toggle Interpolation button will be accessible (enabled by default) in first deformer - Strands Generator properties Note : In some cases interpolation may behave erratically (e.g interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). The most likely cause is - cyclic dependency: - Guide curve depends on your base mesh (usually scalp), - Base Mesh (with Hair System attached) depends on guide curve (through enabled interpolation to Parent - Guide Curve). To fix it and break the cyclic dependency use Transfer Hair System and move Hair System to either Empty Mesh or Guide Curve. Since Hair Tool 3.0 and later versions, strands interpolation operates within areas surrounded by mesh islands - meaning, if you want to make hairstyle with split: split scalp mesh in two, without separating to new object, (e.g. select edge loop, that divides the scalp in half - and press 'V' to rip it). Now child strands will not cross this edge. Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above I have cut mesh in 4 parts (visualised with 4 colors). Strands won't cross islands boundaries Note : If you want to make hairstyle with split, you can use Select By Island to select guide strands from specific island Note : instead of splitting the edges physically, you can use the Edges split modifier Hair sub-System menu \u00b6 You can copy settings from any hair system, and paste to target using entries above. Bake Up to Active SubSystem to Curve - Bake curves generated by active (and preceding) Hair Sub-systems into curve object geometry. Works only if Hair System is attached to hair curve type of objects! (Ctr+Shift+H > Transfer Hair System > to Empty Curve or to Guide Curve) Bake All SubSystems To Curve - Bake curves generated by All Hair sub-systems into curves geometry. Works only if Hair System is attached to hair curve type of object! (Ctr+Shift+H > Transfer Hair System > to Empty Curve or to Guide Curve) Update Node Pack - Update selected Hair Components (geometry node setup) to its latest version (for example after updating HTool) Copy Hair System Settings - Copy Hair System settings from: active Hair sub-System, or from all sub-Systems Paste Hair System Settings - Paste Hair System settings to: active Hair sub-System, or to all sub-Systems Your browser does not support the video tag. Copying All SubSystems (and profile settings) from one object to another. Receiving object has to have at least one Hair subSystem attached. Also make sure both objects share same vertex groups, similar sharp (or crease) edges - if you copy Curves From Grid type of setup Pasting Hair System settings (or instancing object that uses Hair System), will create linked copy. This means that change performed on new copy, will affect original Hair subSystem too. Number of Hair System users is displayed next to Hair Tag (green box in image above) Note: You can unlink Hair System, by clicking on 'users number' (see green box above) Tags \u00b6 You can think of Tags as labels assigned to Hair System strands. With Tags you can set child-parent relations or modify filtered strands with deformers . Why don't we just use system name - rather than introducing new feature? The difference is you can assign multiple tags to same strand e.g.: System A: LONG and CURLY . System B: LONG Now you can modify LONG tag without having to repeat same operations on system A and B twice. In addition, Tags can be assigned to subset of strands from within Hair System: you can use vertex group to select right half of hair strands and tag them as CURLY . Later you can modify only this tag or use it as parent. In image above we assigned A tag to 'First' Hair System. Guide curves have GUIDE tag - assigned automatically You can assign Tag in two ways: by typing it in next to system name see A tag in image above. If not tag was assigned then [TAG] label is shown by using Assign Tag deformer you can also assign tags to Hair System guide object (new Curve Hair) using Tags Panel . See Below Tags Panel \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above we create Tag A , then assign selected curves to tag A using Assign button Note : Assigning Tags only works on new Hair Curves. To be able to select individual curves, like in video above, you have to use Hair Modeling mode . For now only selection works from all the available Modeling Tools Hair Deformers \u00b6 Deformers gives you ability change chair look - add noise to hair, make them curl, snap to surface etc. They are stacked one on top of each other in similar way than Blender modifiers. They can be reordered. Some deformers (e.g. clump, twist, braids) will only work, if Hair System, to which deformers belong to is Set as Child Braids (Child) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clump child strands to Guide/Parent strands (FIRST tag) in shape of Braids. Set Hair System as child first Color Set (System) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. It will alow your to colorize haircards generated inside current hair system (added mostly for debugging hair sub-systems setups) Clumps (Child) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clumps child strands toward parent strands. Set Hair System as child first Curls \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clump child strands to Guide/Parent strands (FIRST tag) in shape of Curls. Can be used with Hair System as child first Generators \u00b6 Duplicate Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Simple duplication of exisitng strands Braid Generator \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Each strand will be duplicated 2 times (3 strands with original one), and braided together. Works best with 'Circular' Profile The Idea in above video is: Take single strand, and convert it to 3 braided ones with 'Braid Generator' Duplicate each sub-strand few times with Duplicate Strands deformer Add some randomization with Noise deformer and UV Region Set deformer This should make it more volumetric looking, since braid will be made from multiple textured haircards, rather than single one. Instance on Strand \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Instance any mesh on hair Strands (can be used to eg. add tie and tail on the end of braid) - since HTool 2.44 Mirror \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Mirror hair, with optional option of bisect (remove one half of hair first, then mirror the remaining part) Move in/out of Surface \u00b6 Embed Roots \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Helps to push hair roots into surface. Best to used before Align Tilt deformer, since it can lead to haircard twisting Push Out \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Push hair outside surface. Useful when wanting to push out layer of hair or to prevent hair clipping through character geometry Attach To Surface \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Attach hair to surface. Useful when wanting to 'glue' hair to character geometry (scalp) Move to Border \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In the video above, a source mesh is created using two half-sphere meshes. We use the \"Move to Border\" deformer to move the strands to the edge of this mesh. Then, we apply the 'Track To Mesh' deformer, to clump tips of strands together Snap \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Snap hair to source surface (could be used for wet hair effect) Lengthen \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Lenghtens hair strands. Unlike simple scale - it will make hair extend from the tips Noise \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Add noise distortion to strands Radius Set \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Set Radius - for hair tapering, strand width randomization, etc. Can also guide Curls amplitude or Braid size - for child Hair Systems Roll Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Basically the same as blender build-in Roll Scale \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Scale hair up or down. With trim deformer we can reduce length of hair, but Scale deformer helps to make them longer. Simplify Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Resamples strands - assigning lower points count to shorter strands Slide Points \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Give more resolution to hair root or tips (depending on 'Influence Range'), by 'sliding' points along the curves Smooth Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Smooth out the strands Tag \u00b6 Assign Tag \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Here we assign R tag to right side of head (using vertex group). Then in following 'Scale' Hair System we can reffer to this tag using Strands Filter -> Affect Tag. This way only right side is affected (Scaled) Note : Assigning any tag e.g. X will create negative tag 'X, for example if we create tag RIGHT with some strands, then tag 'RIGHT will contain opposite set of strands. Delete Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Simple delete strands operation based on their Tag. In video above I removed strands tagged as R then GUIDE strands (bit hard too see, since they are covered by other strands) Tilt \u00b6 Add Tilt \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Add tilt to hair strands. If 'Flip Probability' is 0.5 - then half strands will be rotated clockwise and half counter clockwise Align Tilt \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Aligns tilt to hair source surface (hair normal will point outside of surface) Align Tilt to Parent \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Aligns tilt to Parent (Guide) strands. Hair card backfaces are shown in blue. Great for Dragon Ball hairstyle :) Align Tilt to Target \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Aligns tilt to target surface (hair normal will point outside of target surface) Align Tilt to Mesh Border \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Align strands tilt to border of source surface (usually scalp). Backfaces are shown in blue Force Align if checked, it will align curve and force curve normal to point outside border edge. If unchecked, tilt will be aligned to border, but curve normal will point with the 'flow' - see video above. Track To: \u00b6 Track to Mesh \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Track to Mesh - Strands from closes mesh island will follow tracked mesh object. Use Bind button to prevets hair tips from 'sliding' on mesh surface Note : Closest affected island is determined by Tracked object origin. Move it to change which island will be affected. After finding desired island, you can move tracked object in edit mode, so that affected strands won't change. Note : If you want to 'Freeze' tracked points, use 'Bind Tracked Mesh' button. Now strands will follow point at which they were bound, rather than sliding around mesh surface. Track to Curve \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Track to Curve - Strands from closes mesh island will follow tracked curve object. Use Bind button to prevets hair tips from 'sliding' on tracked surface surface Note : Closest affected island is determined by Tracked object origin. Move it to change which island will be affected. After finding desired island, you can move tracked object in edit mode, so that affected strands won't change. Note : If you want to 'Freeze' tracked points, use 'Bind Tracked Curve' button (this will convert 'old' curve to 'new' type). Now strands will follow point at which they were bound, rather than sliding around curve surface. Note : Curve Shape Keys are great addition to Track To Curve deformer. Trim \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. It will shorten strands roots and/or tips. Best to use with randomization mask Twist \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Twist effect requires to set Hair System to be set as child . For best effect is is good idea to place it after Clump deformer UV Region Set \u00b6 Hair Profile holds UV data (like UV boxes dimensions), but it does not tell which strand will receive which UV region. This is where 'UV Region Set' deformer comes in. It is created automatically when Assigning UV Regions . Add multiple 'UV Region Set' deformers, if you want to achieve layered UVs. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can use multiple 'Set UV Regions' Deformers, and stack them on top of each other (think of them as layers). In video above, I used 2nd Region (green) as base layer, then added 0th Region (purple) on top - masked by vertex group You can also use Set UV Region , and it will automatically create new 'UV Region Set' Deformer (or use active one if selected in Deformer Stack) If not UVs were assigned to current Hair System object, then running 'Set UV Regions' operator will add default UVs (with single UV box/region) Input Masks \u00b6 You can mask most of the hair deformers inputs with various kind of effects. Multiple masks can be added. Note : The order matters: first top mask is evaluated then next to the bottom Your browser does not support the video tag. To add mask click drop down menu icon on right and pick mask type Border Edge Distance \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Border Edge Distance : mask an effect based on strands distance to border of source mesh. Above we used Align Tilt to Mesh Border deformer, to align tilt only on strands that are closest to mesh border. It has invert option too. Curve Attribute \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Curve Attribute : Use Curve attribute to mask hair effect. This is intended to be used with Edit Curve Attribute feature in HTool Vertex Group/Texture \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Vertex Group/Texture : Use vertex group or texture for input masking Offset/Gain \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Mask Offset Gain : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it can increase the mask contrast (gain) or brightness (offset) Invert \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Invert : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it will invert the previous mask effect Randomize \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Randomize : Outputs random value for each strand. Random value will be picked from within [x-RandRange; x+RandRange] bounds, where x - is any input value - e.g. from vertex group mask You can disable lower/upper bound using < / > buttons, thus limiting Random value range. Rand Range - 0 - no randomization; 1 - maximum randomization Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly smaller values, from within given range, Variance == 0.5 all random values are drawn uniformly, from within given range, Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly bigger values, from within given range, Use Parent IDs - if enabled each child strand will inherit random value from its closest parent. Length Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Assigns Min value to the shortest strands, Assigns Max value to the longest strands. Swapping Min and Max values will invert the effect Procedural Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Procedural Mask : Use procedural noise texture to randomize hair look. No need for UVs Min, Max - bring these values closer together to get sharper noise transition, Scale - the bigger scale the more detailed the texture will be, Distort - distorts the noise, Offset - offset the noise sampling position Influence Range \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Special mask that allows to modulate influence of deformer over strand length (e.g. taper only tip of strand). 0 - no effect, 1 - maximum effect Types of Influence range masks: Constant - the effect is uniform along the whole strand length Simple - gradually changes the influence from 0 to 100%. Influence can be flipped using invert button Quadratic - gives more detailed control: modulate effect independently at strand beginning, center and end Profile Curve - most detailed control using profile curve Updating \u00b6 After updating Hair Tool add-on, you may need to update your Hair Setup: There is option to update Individual Hair System elements (Deformers, Masks, Profiles etc.) - located in Deformers dropdown menu Setup and Profile node (green and blue box on image below) Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene. Be warned though: add-on will try to recreate whole node tree structure from scratch, so this may now always work. You may update deformer, profile, mask etc. nodes using menu above Note :: Using individual node packs update (only Deformers, or only Masks etc.) method is usually safer. Limitations \u00b6 Only One UV box can be assigned to profile - you can use Mesh Profile with multiple meshes as a workaround for randomizing UVs (No longer the case Since HT 2.44) Hair Modeling Tools do not work (except selection) Hair interpolation is using booleans under the hood. Because of this, interpolation may fail if boolean fails. And Interpolation may be slow on heavy base meshes (I recommend using lowpoly hair surface meshes). Hopefully I will find better way in the future, to create interpolations. (No longer the case since Blender 3.5 and Hair Tool 2.44) FAQ \u00b6 I get Errors in console \u00b6 If you open old blend file with old Hair Tool setup, after you updated Hair Tool, you may get some errors, and UI wont be drawn correctly. Use Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene Warning this is potentially destructive operation, since whole node tree will be recreated from scratch. Updated nodes behavior may change, resulting in slightly different hair look Hair Interpolation won't work \u00b6 In some cases interpolation may behave erratically (e.g interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). The most likely cause is - cyclic dependency between Base Mesh with attached Hair System and Guide Curve. See note in Hair Iterpolation section.

In this modeling technique we are instancing haircards on mesh edges (haircard count will be the same as character mesh edges count). Useful for creation of fur. Note Short Hair modeling requires Blender 3.3 or above. The main advantages: easy to setup - one click solution easy to tweak with blender sculpting tools (or with poly modeling) haircards distribution based on source character mesh topology - you will automatically get denser hair in more important areas: head, hands (but this can be con - depending on situation) The main cons: no easy way to control density - since density is based on source character mesh topology (you cant drive it with e.g. vertex group) hair source mesh has to have same topology as hair guide mesh. This mean you may have to start combing from scratch if change base mesh topology (but there is workaround I will show later) Note : You can tweak haircards density by changing base mesh topology - eg. by using remesh modifier or adaptive tessellation in blender sculpt mode. How To use \u00b6 Select your character. Let's assume it is named: Body Use Ctrl+Shift+H menu -> 'Setup Short Hair' Alternatively you can use: right sidebar (N key) -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel -> 'Setup Short Hair' Two new objects will be added: Body_short_hair (hair object) and Body_hair_guide (drawn as bounding box) Select hair guide object (bounding box) and go into sculpt mode that is it, you can now sculpt hair by sculpting guide mesh (polygonal modeling can be used too) Note To finalize Short hair use 'Convert Short Hair to Mesh' from Hair Tool Ctrl+Shift+H menu. This will correctly tranfser UVs from modifier to mesh data Remeshing Modes: \u00b6 When you use 'Setup Short Hair' operator, you will have option to remesh base geometry (or leave it as it is). Since haircards are spawned on each mesh edge, then source mesh topology has big influence on Short Hair look Three main modes of remeshing starting from left: Diamonds, Triangulated Diamonds, Triangulated Cells Base Suzanne is made from around 1000 edges. Meaning Short Hair will spawn 1000 haircards (planes or ribbons) Diamond Topology will create 2000 edges Diamond Triangulated will create 3000 edges Triangulated Cells will output 4600 edges! Cells remeshing - gives highest poly-count but the resulting topology is organic and thanks to this haircards will also be distributed in natural way. Diamonds topology, on the other hand, has visible repeating pattern and it may show through on generated haircards. Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh Defining UVs \u00b6 UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs. Select Short Hair object open UV Image Editor and press \u2018Hair UV\u2019 button located in top header bar - on far right then draw UV boxes like it is shown in Defining UVs . The only difference, compared to curves, is that UV mirroring is automatically enabled. Uv Region defined above can be distributed/assigned to hair-cards in two ways - using Vertex Groups as UV mask, or manually. Manual UV assignment \u00b6 You can manually select mesh parts and assign uv regions to it Set UV Region : Select Short Hair object, and go into Edit Mode (using Tab key) Select edges for which you want to assign new UV regions Use Ctrl + Shift + H menu -> Set UV Region , and pick UVs that you want to assign to selection. Short Hair Cards generated at these edges will receive new UVs. Set UVs using Vertex Groups \u00b6 Semi-automatic way of assigning UVs using Vertex groups (access from right Sidebar -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel) We have [L]eft and [R]ight vertex groups. We can use these to assign different UV regions With above setup, UV_1 region will be assigned to hair-cards on [L]eft, and UV_2 region on [R]ight Note : First entry (Base UV) in vert Group layers is always used as 'Background' layer - meaning UV regions assigned to it, will be distributed on whole character body.
