Hair Tool Modeling Tool can be accessed from left sidebar(T) (see icon outlined in red on the image above) Installation \u00b6 To install Hair Tool you need zip file from your Gumroad account. Then, inside Blender, go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons, and click ' Install ' button. And navigate to hair_tool_3.xy.zip file location. For Blender 3.6 use hair_tool_3.x zip files! Updating \u00b6 Hair Tool has build-in auto updater which will download and install the latest add-on release. To use auto updater go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Hair Tool > press Check for update . If new version is found, press Update addon button, wait few seconds and restart blender. Note: To prevent excessive email notifications and minimize spam, I publish smaller updates and bug fixes without increasing the version number. When enough new features or fixes are implemented, I release a new official version with an increased release number. If you want to get the 'smaller' bugfixes but the addon shows that you already have the latest version, use Reinstall Current Version . This will download the smaller incremental bug fixes.. You can also download updates manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Hair Tool. Checking for new version of Hair Tool from Preferences panel Limitations \u00b6 No cross-profile support (X like profile - where profile is made from two crossing haircards). It is on my TODO list Implemented in HTool 4.0 Pasting hair-preset won't work (using blenders Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V). This is due to Blender limitation. As a workaround is to store preset in hair library and then append it from there to new file. If you use 'Add' brush in hair curve Sculpt Mode, profile will not be visible on new strands. This is due to bug in Blender - reported here . As a workaround use 'Set Radius' deformer with 'Build up' option disabled - to override haircard radius to 1. Fixed in Blender 4.2 You can't move vertices in curve Edit Mode, if 'Strands Overlay' is enabled. This is due to bug in Blender - reported [here] (https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/116763). Fixed in Blender 4.2 Undo won't work after editing curve radius in Curve Edit mode.

If you can't run the addon, \"auto-updater\" won't work. In that case you will have to download update manually I need to use old Blender For Blender 4.2+ - use Hair Tool 4.x + 'HairLibrary_4.x_date.zip' For Blender 3.6-4.1 - use Hair Tool 3.x, and HairLibrary_3.x_date.zip For Blender 3.3-3.6 - use Hair Tool. 2.46 (last version that supports 'old' curves), and HairLib_18_12_2022.zip Remove Old hair_tool folder sometimes old files from previous Hair Tool version may give trouble after update, if they are not removed (auto-updater deals with this automatically) Hair Tool folder is placed in your addons directory remove hair_tool folder from your ./addons/ directory restart Blender install Hair Tool again from zip file - this usually fixes installation problems Conflict with another add-ons If it still won't work, it is not often, but there may be conflict with another addon, or your blender setup may be corrupted. Try this: Restart Blender > then use File menu -> Defaults -> Load Factory Settings -> enable Hair Tool now. If Hair Tool works now, then it means, that your old config was corrupted, or there was conflict with another addon If above helped, then you may need to set up your blender config from scratch. Texture looks wrong \u00b6 Check if your hair material and UV_Data object are assigned correctly inside Profile section. Profile is place where material is assigned to hair strands., and hair UV shape (boxes) is stored If your UV_Data object is missing, you can create it by using Hair UV operator (or copy it from another object profile) Even if your UVs from (1) are assigned ok, you should check theirs shape in UV/Image Editor. Run Hair UV operator, and you should see UV Boxes/Regions similar this: Example of default hair UVs - made from five UV Regions (boxes) In your hair material: make sure that hair UVs are properly read from HTool_UV node and make sure that your image node is connected to it. When HTOOL_UV is linked to material output, it should have green+red tint Using Define UV will generate 'UV_Data` (and assign it to profile), but it will not assign individual UV boxes (regions) to hair strands. For that use UV Regions Distribute deformer (for procedural strands) or Set UV Regions operator (for 'real' strands). Sometimes UVs may not be generated correctly, if Profile node is out of date. Update it using 'Update Whole Profile' button from image below: Greyed out parameters panel \u00b6 Go to Preferences > System > Enable 'Global Undo'. You may need to restart blender after saving settings. It looks like blender bug, and from time to time this option is disabled for no reason. How do I export hair? \u00b6 Hair generated in Hair Tool can be exported just like any other mesh (File > Export > FBX). Just make sure to Convert Curves to Mesh hair first. How do I export hair texture? \u00b6 If you are using default Hair Tool hair material, then it is using just one texture - alpha mask. You can export it from UV Editor (or Image Editor) > Image menu > Save as: Note : Build-in HTool hair shader has complicated shader nodes setup, that allows them to look nice in Eevee. It is impossible to copy it to another game engines. If you want to create more complicated setup, with multiple texture types, you should use Hair Baking scene, where you can set up you hair and bake them as images to target directory. How do I animate Hair? \u00b6 There is no one way to animate hair, but usually I recommend using simple softbody mesh as deformer for actual hair like it is shown in video below: There is now built-in option to animate hair using Jiggle Bones see Animation Error when using Curves from Grid surface \u00b6 Make sure your source grid surface has proper topology.

If you can't run the addon, \"auto-updater\" won't work. In that case you will have to download update manually I need to use old Blender For Blender 4.2+ - use Hair Tool 4.x + 'HairLibrary_4.x_date.zip' For Blender 3.6-4.1 - use Hair Tool 3.x, and HairLibrary_3.x_date.zip For Blender 3.3-3.6 - use Hair Tool. 2.46 (last version that supports 'old' curves), and HairLib_18_12_2022.zip Remove Old hair_tool folder sometimes old files from previous Hair Tool version may give trouble after update, if they are not removed (auto-updater deals with this automatically) Hair Tool folder is placed in your addons directory remove hair_tool folder from your ./addons/ directory restart Blender install Hair Tool again from zip file - this usually fixes installation problems Conflict with another add-ons If it still won't work, it is not often, but there may be conflict with another addon, or your blender setup may be corrupted. Try this: Restart Blender > then use File menu -> Defaults -> Load Factory Settings -> enable Hair Tool now.

UVs will work in similar way to how Flat Profile UVs work - use UV Region Distribute deformer and Set UV Region operator to distribute UVs onto hair curves. Note : Fastest way to generate curve profile objects is to use Generate Curves from UV button (close to the bottom of Profile panel) Note : to define which strand will receive which profile object use Distribute Profile deformer Round Profile. \u00b6 It is only needed in hair texture baking setup. It does not support UV mapping, so it is not suitable for Haircards rendering Circle Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Adjusting Circle Profile by changing Roundness, Bow up and Bevel parameters Width - hair-card width Resolution - resolution along strand length (more segments, gives smoother look without having to add more points to hair curve) Profile Resolution - resolution of profile cross-section Roundness - how round profile is. 0.0 will give more flat look Bow Up - This controls how much the profile shape curves upwards. 0 will make the shape round Bevel Center - number of extra bevel segments to add on center edge of profile. Looks best on flatter profile and some bow up Bevel Width - how wide the bevel is Braid Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In demo above you can see both curve taper (and tilt) is affecting the generated braids shape (at the very end of video) Global Scale - default value 1.0 is good for default cube (2 meters in size). For human head (which is 1/10th of default cube size) set it to 0.1 Frequency - how dense braid interlacing is Main Radius - overall braid size Max Radius - radius at the braid thickest point Min Radius - radius at the braid thinnest point Radius Contrast - blend shape between Max and Min Radius. 0.0 will give more uniform radius along braid Radius Skewing - how much each braid 'period' is skewed. Higher values will give more 'heart' like shape Profile Roundness - how round braid profile is. 0.0 will give more flat look (it looks best with low 'Flatness' parameter) Braid Resolution Factor - how many points should be generated for each period on braid (higher == smoother look) Frequency from Radius rate - The smaller the radius of guide curve, the more dense the braid becomes. Controls the rate of this change Tile UV - UVs will repeat along braid length Tile Size - number of periods for UVs Tiling (default 1) Tile Seed - when 'Tile Size' is greater than 1, this will add random offset to UV tiling for each strand Curls Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Example of Curls Profile Global Scale - default value 1.0 is good for default cube (2 meters in size). For human head (which is 1/10th of default cube size) set it to 0.1 Frequency - how 'dense' curls are Amplitude - overall curls size Width - hair-card width Width From UV - narrower UV region will give narrower hair-card Use Random UV Flip - randomly flip UVs in X axis Gravity - Curls get tenser at the endings Influence Range - Blend between straight strand and curl over strand length Influence Width - control the strand width over its length Mesh Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Above I show how to generate and instance multiple meshes along hairstrands (video is narrated) Mesh profile objects should point up, and theirs origin be at the bottom. Otherwise, they may not align correctly to hair strands. Their length is not normalized, meaning taller objects will be longer after placing on hair strands (by match profile objects height > gives them same length). Note : Since release of Hair Tool 4.x you can now manually assign profile object to each hair strand with Profile Distribute deformer or Set Profile ID operator Note : Fastest way to generate multiple mesh profile objects is to use Generate mesh cards from UV button (at the bottom of Profile panel) Slice Mesh Profile button will cut object using custom 'slicing' modifier. This way mesh will conform better to hair splines Note : Slice Mesh Profile is using boolean operation in background. It may fail on more complicated objects - e.g. when mesh has self intersections. Hair System UVs will be ignored when using 'Mesh Profile' and the individual instanced mesh object UVs will be used instead. Using multiple copies of same objects, with different UVs, is a good way to add some randomization to hair look. Profile Menu \u00b6 In this menu you can find various options for managing hair profiles. Copy And Paste Profile - copy profile from one hair system to another. It will copy all profile settings, UVs and material. Update Profile Node Pack - update node pack for selected profile. It will update all nodes in node pack, and also add missing nodes. It is useful when you want to update profile node pack to latest version. Make Profile Unique - unlink active profile settings from other hair systems (e.g. after pasting profile from another hair system). Your browser does not support the video tag. Mesh From UV Boxes Create multiple mesh objects, based on Hair System UV boxes/regions. Use these objects as target in: Hair System > Profile Tab : Mesh Profile UVs Menu - helper for copying and pasting profile UV_data, between Hair System profiles Profile Other Settings \u00b6 This sub-section of Profile panel contains extra profile options (UV and Color Sampling, profile simplification etc.) Generate Attributes \u00b6 Generate extra attributes that can be used in hair material : Tangent - required for proper specular highlights (only if you use Hair Tool hair material) Factor - black and white gradient attribute along each strand length Random - each haircard will get random grayscale color attribute Sample UV - pick name of UV channel, that you want transfer from Source Surface mesh to strands. This attribute can be then accessed in Hair Material using Attribute Node with name SampledUV Sample Color - pick name of vertex Color that you want transfer from Source Surface mesh to strands. This attribute can be then accessed in Hair material using Attribute Node with name SampledColor In setup above we sample UVMap from sphere. This generates attribute named SampledUV , which can be used to color strands with same texture as character body Simplify Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag.

They give you ability change chair look: add noise, curls, snap to surface et c. Deformers are stacked on top of each other, just like Blender modifiers. Note : Some deformers (e.g. clump, twist, braids) will only work, if Hair System (to which deformer belongs to) is Set as Child Note : Most of the input properties of Deformers can be masked by input masks like: vertex group, texture, length mask etc. Animation \u00b6 Attach Curves UV \u00b6 Attach strands roots to source mesh UVs. Without it hair won't follow animated mesh ('Surface Deform' modifier will not work). Bake/Cache Hair \u00b6 Save hair strands into cached memory. They will no longer be editable, but will be faster to animate, since they will not be re-generated on every frame change. Surface Deform \u00b6 Same as blender built-in modifier. Allows hair to follow source mesh deformation (by rig or shape keys). Note : You may want to use Bake deformer first, so that strands will not be regenerated on every frame Physics \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can add collision objects, control: wind, gravity, damping etc. Not perfect yet, but can give some nice results. For more advanced physics simulation we may need to wait for native blender geo-nodes physics integration. Note : You may want to use Bake deformer first, so that strands will not be regenerated on every frame Note : If you notice some jittering, try reducing gravity and increasing damping. For now self collisions are disabled, since you would have to subdivide strands a lot, to get good results. Long hair simulation may not look the best. But at least new HTool 4.x physics does not exploade like it used to in HT 3.x Assign Group ID \u00b6 Assign Group ID attribute to strands.

It will allow your to colorize haircards material with generated SystemColor attribute . You can enable `Use HSV sliders' and combine them with Input Masks to create some nice effects Clumps (Child) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clumps child strands toward parent strands. Set Hair System as child first Curls \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Simple duplication of existing strands Braid Generator \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Each strand will be duplicated 2 times (3 strands with original one), and braided together. Works best with 'Circular' Profile The Idea in above video is: Take single strand, and convert it to 3 braided ones with 'Braid Generator' Duplicate each sub-strand few times with Duplicate Strands deformer Add some randomization with Noise deformer and UV Region Distribute deformer This should make it more volumetric looking, since braid will be made from multiple textured haircards, rather than single one. Instance on Strand \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Mirror hair, with optional option of bisect (remove one half of hair first, then mirror the remaining part) Move in/out of Surface \u00b6 Embed Roots \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Helps to push hair roots into surface. Best to used before Align Tilt deformer, since it can lead to haircard twisting Push Out \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Pushes hair strands away from the surface. Use to preventing clipping through character geometr or adding volume for layered hair styles Attach To Surface \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Attach hair to surface. Useful when wanting to 'glue' hair roots to character geometry (scalp) Move to Border \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In the video above, a source mesh is created using two half-sphere meshes. We use the \"Move to Border\" deformer to move the strands to the edge of this mesh. Then, we apply the 'Track To Mesh' deformer, to clump tips of strands together Note : Often I like to move hair to border but only for strands that are within certain distance to the border. This can be done by using Border Edge Distance input mask. This way we can keep some strands in the middle of the scalp, while moving others to the border. Snap \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Snap hair to source surface (could be used for wet hair effect) Lengthen \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Lenghtens hair strands. Unlike simple scale - it will make hair extend from the tips Noise \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Adding Uniofomr noise, to break up the straightness of the strands and then bit of 'Per Strands' noise to add some randomness to the strands Global Scale - Scales overall noise effect. Default value 1.0 is good for default cube (2 meters in size). For human head (which is around 1/10th of its size) set it to 0.1 Uniform Noise - it will give overall flow to the hair, breaking up the straightness of the strands. Per Strands Noise - this will apply unique noise to each strand, giving it a more messy look. Frequency - controls the detail of the noise. If set too high, it will make hair look 'bumpy' and unnatural. Influence Range - Blend between original (straight) strand and the noise effect. Flatten along Normal - it will remove the normal component of the noise, making it look more like than a 'wave'. Note : Higher values of noise can push hair into the character head. To prevent this, use Push Out deformer after the noise deformer. Radius Set \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag.

With Separate Target per Island strands from one (closest) island will follow the guide. To prevent hair tips from 'sliding' use Bind Track Mesh button In deformer settings you have control over shape of 'glued' curves - they can go straight or bent toward the target mesh. Note : Closest active/affected island is determined by Tracked object origin. Move it to change 'active' island. Note : It is good idea to create 'bind' shape-key, just after 'Bind Track Mesh' is pressed, on tracked mesh, and then work on extra 'Deform' shape-key. This way you can restore original 'bind' shape, re-run the 'Bind' and then switch back to 'Deform' shape-key.

Parent system is guided by: HairCurve guide (second input at very top) Sub-Systems Types \u00b6 After adding a hair (sub)system, the first slot in the deformers stack is automatically added, with its type determined by the selected hair sub-system type. Strands Generator \u00b6 It will grow strands, from Base Mesh surface. You can control parameters like: resolution, density, length, interpolation ( Parent Child relation must be set ) etc. These strands are affected by all subsequent deformers in current system stack Your browser does not support the video tag. Set parent Tags and enable interplation option, so that generated strands will follow these Tagged strands. See Child Parent Setup Strands Distribution \u00b6 Poisson distribution is a better way to spread things out evenly than just randomly placing them. Here's why: Imagine you're trying to place hair strands on a surface. Random placement: You might end up with clumps of hair in some areas and gaps in others. Poisson distribution: This method makes sure the hair is spread out more evenly. It does this by removing any hair strands that are too close together. Left : notice the clumping of hair roots; Center : Poisson distribution fixes clumps issue, by removing roots (marked in black) that are closer than Min Distance parameter. Right : Increase Density parameter to fill up the empty spots Relax Distribution \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Relax option - useful when you masked Density input - e.g. with vertex group (masking Density results in non uniform strands distribution) Strands Filter \u00b6 Imagine you want to modify multiple Hair Systems, by adding Set Radius or Align Tilt . Instead of adding these deformers to each individual Hair subSystem, one by one, you can utilize the Filter System to affect all previously generated strands simultaneously . All type of strands can be modified: 'real' strands (for example generated with Hair Drawing ), or generated procedurally by another Hair subSystem e.g. Strands Generator . Note : If no filter tag is specified, then all strands will be affected. Otherwise only strands with specified tag will be affected. Your browser does not support the video tag. Demo of applying 'Scale' deformer to strands generated with Right and 'Left' Hair Systems. When no filter Tag is set, then all strands are scaled Strands From Grid Surface \u00b6 This type of Strand Generator, will guide strands using guide mesh (grid mesh, made of quads only). Root of strands will be placed: on edge loop marked as Sharp (Ctrl+E -> Mark Sharp) or on crease edge (Shift+E -> Crease Edge). These strands can be affected by all subsequent deformers in current system stack Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above - top, boundary edge loop was marked as sharp Note : Notice how guide grid, in video above, has uneven topology - getting dense to the right. This is important when adjusting 'Uniform Spacing' option Note : To mask-out placement of roots, just plugin in vertex group mask into 'Placement Mask' input Examples of proper grid guide topology : Check out the FAQ to see examples of wrong mesh topology Interpolated Strands \u00b6 This Strand Generator, will use existing curves add extra strands in between them. In that case order of strand matter! Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above I used drawn strands to guide the 'Interpolated Strands' generator (video is narrated) Note : If order of your strands is wrong, and Automatic Spline Sorting option fails, you can use Sort Strands by Stroke operator to manually fix the order (see video above) Strands from Prism Mesh Guide \u00b6 It will allow you to generate strands on base mesh along 'walls' of prism like mesh. Bottom face has to be separated from 'wall' using sharp edge (see video below) Your browser does not support the video tag. In this example I had marked sharp edges to create face groups/islands (no edge split modifier was used though). Then I extruded these edges, to create valid mesh for 'Strands from Prism Mesh Guide' generator Note1 : Extruding faces, in the way that was done in video above, creates non-manifold mesh, and the resulting prism 'Wall' faces normal's will be messed up (some face out, some in). You can unify them using: Ctrl+N > Recalculate Normal's operator. Note2 : You can use Ctrl+Shift+H > Strands from Prism Mesh operator to: create new (separated) hair object and switch your base mesh display mode to 'WIRE' automatically. This will help you to see both hair-cards and base (prism guide) mesh at the same time. Strands on Mesh Parts \u00b6 It will allow you to generate strands on base mesh: vertices, edges and (or) faces. Your browser does not support the video tag. When used on edges it looks similar to Short Hair . Especially if you combine it with Track to Mesh deformer Strands on Mesh Border \u00b6 It will allow you to generate strands on base mesh border edges (or on custom edge attribute) Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above we combine this strand generator with Track To Curve deformer. Scalp mesh is using Mirror modifier - that is why the strands are also spawned on center line Border Offset move strands away from the border edge. You can randomize it to get more natural hairline look Trim Ends - use to prevent strands spawning on the border edges endings - see 'Split Corner Angle' parameter below Split Corner Angle - scalp from video above has some sharp corners. This parameter will help to split these corners into two edges, so that you can trim them with 'Trim Ends' parameter. UVs - Strands on Mesh Border generator requires non-overlapping UV's on your base mesh, to function properly . Transfer Hair System \u00b6 Hair System can be assigned to Mesh or Curve Hair object, depending on which object is selected when you add Hair System. If you want to change Hair System 'owner' you can use Transfer Hair System operator. Hair System that generates hair-cards (in center above) can be assigned to: Source/Base Mesh mesh from which strands are spawned from (often scalp mesh) Empty Mesh helper, without geometry, usually linked with Source Mesh and Guide Curve Guide Curve curve object that guides strands Empty Curve helper, without geometry, (usually linked with Source Mesh and Guide Curve) Hair system transfer possibilities: Current Owner Transfer To Result Guide Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Guide Curve Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to new, empty mesh object Empty Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Base Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Base Mesh Empty Curve Hair System will be moved to Empty Curve Hair object Base Mesh Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to Empty Mesh object Empty Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Empty Mesh Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Visually, there should not be any noticeable difference. However, the owner of the Hair System will change User cases when you want to use Transfer Hair System: if you want to 'Bake' curves generated by Hair System to curve, but it is assigned to Mesh (meshes cannot receive curves geometry). In that case you can transfer Hair System to Empty Curve, and then bake it to it if hair interpolation is broken (e.g. stops working after you select and try to sculpt Guide Curve. See note in Hair Interpolation section General Operations \u00b6 Remove whole Hair System - removes all Hair Systems, Setup and Profile modifiers from object Update Whole Hair System - updates Setup, Profile, Hair SubSystems (without deformers) nodes. All nodes are recreated from scratch, it is destructive operation and may break your Hair setup! Bake All SubSystems - bake curves generated by All Hair sub-Systems into 'real' curves geometry. This works only on hair curve type of objects (try: Ctr+Shift+H > Transfer Hair System: to Empty Curve, or to Guide Curve) Transfer Hair System - explained here Child - Parent setup \u00b6 Linking two Hair SubSystems, with Child-Parent relation, enables capabilities such as: interpolation, clumping, curls, braids, twist and others. Use Tags to link two Hair SubSystems , establishing a parent-child relationship. Your browser does not support the video tag. In the video above, I show how to make the red strands (called \"ParentSys\") the parent (guide) for the yellow strands (named \"Child\"). You can use any tag name you want. In this example, I used \"RED\". Note : Parent Hair System has to be placed above Child System in the stack, or else Child strands won't 'see' the Parent strands Hair Interpolation \u00b6 To use hair interpolation, your hair system needs a parent set up . You'll see the 'Use Interpolation' button appear in the settings for the first hair deformer - Strands Generator . Align to Surface Normal \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Align to Surface Normal - useful for shorter hair. Do not confuse with Align Tilt To Source Surface Use mesh Islands Splits \u00b6 The Use Mesh Islands Splits option restricts child strands to follow only parent strands from the same mesh island. This feature is particularly useful for creating split hairstyles. To create a split, select an edge loop that divides the scalp in half and press 'V' to rip it. Once split, child strands will remain confined to their respective mesh islands and won't cross the divided edge. Note : instead of splitting the edges physically, you can use the Edges split modifier Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above I have cut mesh in 4 parts (visualised with 4 colors). Strands won't cross islands boundaries Note : For hairstyle with split, I recommend using Select By Island so that you can one click select all strands from particular island. Fixing Interpolation (1) \u00b6 In some cases interpolation may not work (interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). It can be caused by cyclic dependency : Guide curve depends on your base mesh (scalp) - from which it is generated from, Base Mesh may depend on 'Guide Curve' - through attached Hair System and enabled interpolation to Guide Curve The fix is: break the cyclic dependency using Transfer Hair System and move Hair System to either Empty Mesh or Guide Curve. Fixing Interpolation (2) \u00b6 Strands do not go to left/right and instead fall in the middle The reason: imagine new strand (marked with green X above) follows two nearest purple guides. It is causing the strand to go to the center (average of both guides) The fix: split base mesh into two islands (marked with black and white) and enable Use mesh Islands Splits option. Now new strand will follow guides from one side (white or black) - resulting in clean interpolation on right Hair sub-System menu \u00b6 You can copy settings from any hair system, and paste to target using entries above. Bake \u00b6 Procedurally generated strands cannot be groomed. First convert them into 'real' geometry with 'Bake' operator. This will bake: active (and preceding) Hair sub-Systems or All Hair sub-systems into 'real' curve geometry, that can then be groomed using Blender 'Curve Sculpt' mode. Note : Baking works only if Hair System is attached to hair curve type of objects! If not the use: Ctr+Shift+H > Transfer Hair System > to Empty Curve or to Guide Curve) Your browser does not support the video tag. Curves in video cannot be groomed, since they are generated procedurally. After baking, you can groom them without issues Update Node Pack \u00b6 Update selected Hair Components (geometry node setup) to its latest version, for example after updating add-on Copy/Paste Hair System \u00b6 Copy Hair System settings from: Active Hair sub-System or All sub-Systems Paste Hair System settings to: Active Hair sub-System or to All sub-Systems Your browser does not support the video tag. Copying All SubSystems (and profile settings) from one object to another. Receiving object has to have at least one Hair subSystem attached. Also make sure both objects share same vertex groups, similar sharp (or crease) edges - if you copy Curves From Grid type of setup Switch Hair System Type \u00b6 Note : Since release of Hair Tool 4.2 this option is moved to first deformer (strands generator) dropdown menu. Switch Hair System Type - for example from Strands Generator to Strands Filter. Pasting Hair System settings (or instancing object that uses Hair System), will create linked copy. This means that change performed on new copy, will affect original Hair subSystem too. Number of Hair System users is displayed next to Hair Tag (green box in image above) Note: You can unlink Hair System, by clicking on 'users number' (see green box above) Tags \u00b6 Think of Tags as labels we apply to the strands in a Hair System. They enable us to establish child-parent relations or manipulate specific strands with strands filter . Why won't we use system name for that functionality? The reason is, that you can assign multiple tags to same strand e.g.: Hair System A strands Tags: LONG and CURLY . Hair System B strands Tags: LONG Now you can modify strands tagged with LONG label - using Strands Filter , without having to create same deformers on Hair System A then B twice. Tags can be also assigned to subset of strands from within Hair System with Assign Tag deformer. In image above we tagged 'First' Hair System A with label. 'Second' and 'Third' system are linked to it - which allows us to use e.g. interpolation on them. Note: Guide curves received GUIDE tag automatically Tag can be assigned in few ways: by typing it in next to system name see A tag in image above. If system has no tag assigned then [TAG] label is shown by using Assign Tag deformer you can also assign tags to Hair System guide object (new Curve Hair) using Tags Panel . See Below Tags Panel \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above we create Tag A , then assign selected curves to tag A using Assign button Note : Assigning Tags only works on new Hair Curves. To be able to select individual curves, like in video above, you have to use Hair Modeling mode . For now only selection works from all the available Modeling Tools Updating \u00b6 After updating Hair Tool add-on, you may need to update your Hair Setup: There is option to update Individual Hair System elements (Deformers, Masks, Profiles etc.) - located in Deformers dropdown menu Setup and Profile node (green and blue box on image below) Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene. Be warned though: add-on will try to recreate whole node tree structure from scratch, so this may now always work. You may update deformer, profile, mask etc. nodes using menu above Note :: Using individual node packs update (only Deformers, or only Masks etc.) method is usually safer. Limitations \u00b6 Only One UV box can be assigned to profile - you can use Mesh Profile with multiple meshes as a workaround for randomizing UVs (No longer the case Since HT 2.44) Hair Modeling Tools do not work (except selection) Hair interpolation is using booleans under the hood. Because of this, interpolation may fail if boolean fails. And Interpolation may be slow on heavy base meshes (I recommend using lowpoly hair surface meshes). Hopefully I will find better way in the future, to create interpolations. (No longer the case since Blender 3.5 and Hair Tool 2.44) FAQ \u00b6 I get Errors in console \u00b6 If you open old blend file with old Hair Tool setup, after you updated Hair Tool, you may get some errors, and UI wont be drawn correctly. Use Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene Warning this is potentially destructive operation, since whole node tree will be recreated from scratch. Updated nodes behavior may change, resulting in slightly different hair look Hair Interpolation won't work \u00b6 In some cases interpolation may behave erratically (e.g interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). The most likely cause is - cyclic dependency between Base Mesh with attached Hair System and Guide Curve. See note in Hair Interpolation section. To fix the cyclic dependency use Transfer Hair System and move Hair System to either: Empty Mesh or Guide Curve.","title":"Hair System"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#hair-system","text":"","title":"Hair System"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#overview","text":"Three main building-blocks of hair in Hair Tool: Setup, Hair (sub)Systems, Profile In Hair Tool there is concept of: Hair System - it is Blender geometry-nodes based modifier where hair strands are generated and modified .

In this modeling technique we are instancing haircards on mesh edges (haircard count will be the same as character mesh edges count). Useful for creation of fur. Note Short Hair modeling requires Blender 3.3 or above. Example of 'Short hair' by Ellinor Mor\u00e9n The main advantages: easy to setup - one click solution easy to tweak with blender sculpting tools (or with poly modeling) haircards distribution based on source character mesh topology - you will automatically get denser hair in more important areas: head, hands (but this can be con - depending on situation) The main cons: no easy way to control density - since density is based on source character mesh topology (you cant drive it with e.g. vertex group) hair source mesh has to have same topology as hair guide mesh. This mean you may have to start combing from scratch if change base mesh topology (but there is workaround I will show later) Note : You can tweak haircards density by changing base mesh topology - eg. by using remesh modifier or adaptive tessellation in blender sculpt mode. How To use \u00b6 Select your character. Let's assume it is named: Body Use Ctrl+Shift+H menu -> 'Setup Short Hair' Alternatively you can use: right sidebar (N key) -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel -> 'Setup Short Hair' Two new objects will be added: Body_short_hair (hair object) and Body_hair_guide (drawn as bounding box) Select hair guide object (bounding box) and go into sculpt mode that is it, you can now sculpt hair by sculpting guide mesh (polygonal modeling can be used too) Note To finalize Short hair use 'Convert Short Hair to Mesh' from Hair Tool Ctrl+Shift+H menu. This will correctly tranfser UVs from modifier to mesh data Remeshing Modes: \u00b6 When you use 'Setup Short Hair' operator, you will have option to remesh base geometry (or leave it as it is). Since haircards are spawned on each mesh edge, then source mesh topology has big influence on Short Hair look Three main modes of remeshing starting from left: Diamonds, Triangulated Diamonds, Triangulated Cells Base Suzanne is made from around 1000 edges. Meaning Short Hair will spawn 1000 haircards (planes or ribbons) Diamond Topology will create 2000 edges Diamond Triangulated will create 3000 edges Triangulated Cells will output 4600 edges! Cells remeshing - gives highest poly-count but the resulting topology is organic and thanks to this haircards will also be distributed in natural way. Diamonds topology, on the other hand, has visible repeating pattern and it may show through on generated haircards. Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Example of Short Hair generated with Triangulated Diamonds Remeshing Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh Defining UVs \u00b6 UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs. Select Short Hair object open UV Image Editor and press \u2018Hair UV\u2019 button located in top header bar - on far right then draw UV boxes like it is shown in Defining UVs . The only difference, compared to curves, is that UV mirroring is automatically enabled. Uv Region defined above can be distributed/assigned to hair-cards in two ways - using Vertex Groups as UV mask, or manually. Manual UV assignment \u00b6 You can manually select mesh parts and assign uv regions to it Set UV Region : Your browser does not support the video tag. Assigning UV Region with ID: 1 to selected edges Select Short Hair object, and go into Edit Mode (using Tab key) Select edges for which you want to assign new UV regions Use Ctrl + Shift + H menu -> Set UV Region , and pick UVs that you want to assign to selection. Short Hair Cards generated at these edges will receive new UVs. Set UVs using Vertex Groups \u00b6 Semi-automatic way of assigning UVs using Vertex groups (access from right Sidebar -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel) We have [L]eft and [R]ight vertex groups. We can use these to assign different UV regions With above setup, UV_1 region will be assigned to hair-cards on [L]eft, and UV_2 region on [R]ight Note : First entry (Base UV) in vert Group layers is always used as 'Background' layer - meaning UV regions assigned to it, will be distributed on whole character body. Following vertex groups will cover this base layer, with theirs own UV regions. Parameters: \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can change Short Hair parameters by going into modifiers tab. Use Guide Object - You may want to use the modifier without Hair Guide object. This boolean parameter helps to turn off Guide object, without breaking modifier behavior Your browser does not support the video tag. Guide Object - Haircards will follow Guide Object deformations. It does not matter if you modify Deformer object in sculpt mode or in Edit mode, but you can't change Deformer object topology . Deformer object topology has to be the same as base hair object, but shape can (and should) be different. In video above all modification performed on Deformer object are stored in Shape Key - this gives you more control on the shape of the mesh in non destructive way Your browser does not support the video tag. Strand Resolution - Add additional subdivision along strands length Your browser does not support the video tag. Placement Mask - select vertex group to mask the Short Hair effect Your browser does not support the video tag. Puff - Push hair outside of surface. Helps to draw haircards when guide mesh is exactly the same as base mesh, thus haircards would have zero length and they would be invisible Your browser does not support the video tag.

Noise - Helps to break the even look of haircards Coloring Strands \u00b6 Short Hair cards can be colored using vertex color or texture from character body.

Sampled Color - Enter vert color name from sampled base mesh (usually character object) to generate Vert Color layer named SampledCol - it can be used to tint the hair color* Using Sampled UV's \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Sampled Color - Enter UV name from sampled base mesh (usually character object) to generate uv layer named SampledUV - it can be used to tint the hair color* FAQ \u00b6 How setup uniform hair density? \u00b6 You can use remesh modifier to make the base topology even. Generating Short Hair from that should give uniform look I need denser hair \u00b6 There is no way to control Short Hair density. But you can add subdivision modifier to increase the density. This will however bump up haircards count Four Times, for each subdivision. Note 1 You have to add subdivision modifier to both Body (above Short Hair mod), and Hair Deformer object or Short Hair won't work correctly. Note 2 You can also try using Dyntopo in Blender sculpting mode, to add more geometry in places where you want more hair I want to use UVs/Weights from my base mesh on Hair \u00b6 Use Data Transfer modifier, after you finalized your Short Hair.","title":"Short Hair"},{"location":"main_workflows/short_hair/#short-hair-modeling-tool","text":"Your browser does not support the video tag. In this modeling technique we are instancing haircards on mesh edges (haircard count will be the same as character mesh edges count). Useful for creation of fur. Note Short Hair modeling requires Blender 3.3 or above. Example of 'Short hair' by Ellinor Mor\u00e9n The main advantages: easy to setup - one click solution easy to tweak with blender sculpting tools (or with poly modeling) haircards distribution based on source character mesh topology - you will automatically get denser hair in more important areas: head, hands (but this can be con - depending on situation) The main cons: no easy way to control density - since density is based on source character mesh topology (you cant drive it with e.g. vertex group) hair source mesh has to have same topology as hair guide mesh. This mean you may have to start combing from scratch if change base mesh topology (but there is workaround I will show later) Note : You can tweak haircards density by changing base mesh topology - eg. by using remesh modifier or adaptive tessellation in blender sculpt mode.","title":"Short Hair Modeling Tool"},{"location":"main_workflows/short_hair/#how-to-use","text":"Select your character. Let's assume it is named: Body Use Ctrl+Shift+H menu -> 'Setup Short Hair' Alternatively you can use: right sidebar (N key) -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel -> 'Setup Short Hair' Two new objects will be added: Body_short_hair (hair object) and Body_hair_guide (drawn as bounding box) Select hair guide object (bounding box) and go into sculpt mode that is it, you can now sculpt hair by sculpting guide mesh (polygonal modeling can be used too) Note To finalize Short hair use 'Convert Short Hair to Mesh' from Hair Tool Ctrl+Shift+H menu.

Since haircards are spawned on each mesh edge, then source mesh topology has big influence on Short Hair look Three main modes of remeshing starting from left: Diamonds, Triangulated Diamonds, Triangulated Cells Base Suzanne is made from around 1000 edges. Meaning Short Hair will spawn 1000 haircards (planes or ribbons) Diamond Topology will create 2000 edges Diamond Triangulated will create 3000 edges Triangulated Cells will output 4600 edges! Cells remeshing - gives highest poly-count but the resulting topology is organic and thanks to this haircards will also be distributed in natural way. Diamonds topology, on the other hand, has visible repeating pattern and it may show through on generated haircards. Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Example of Short Hair generated with Triangulated Diamonds Remeshing Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh","title":"Remeshing Modes:"},{"location":"main_workflows/short_hair/#defining-uvs","text":"UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs.
