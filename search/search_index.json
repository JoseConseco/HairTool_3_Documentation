There is also Hair Tool panel - located in right Sidebar(N): \"Hair Tool\" tab. Last but not least, you can find Hair Tool Modeling Tool in left sidebar(T) in - see icon outlined in yellow on the image above. Installation \u00b6 To install Hair Tool you need zip file from your Gumroad account. Then, inside Blender, go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons, and click ' Install ' button. And navigate to hair_tool_3.xy.zip file location. For Blender 3.6 use hair_tool_3.x zip files! Updating \u00b6 Hair Tool has build-in auto updater which will download and install the latest add-on release. To use auto updater go to: Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Hair Tool > press Check for update . If new version is found, press Update addon button, wait few seconds and restart blender. Note: To prevent excessive email notifications and minimize spam, I publish smaller updates and bug fixes without increasing the version number. When enough new features or fixes are implemented, I release a new official version with an increased release number. If you want to get the 'smaller' bugfixes but the addon shows that you already have the latest version, use Reinstall Current Version . This will download the smaller incremental bug fixes.. You can also download updates manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Hair Tool. Checking for new version of Hair Tool from Preferences panel Limitations \u00b6 No cross-profile support (X like profile - where profile is made from two crossing haircards). It is on my TODO list Implemented in HTool 4.0 Pasting hair-preset won't work (using blenders Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V). This is due to Blender limitation. As a workaround is to store preset in hair library and then append it from there to new file. If you use 'Add' brush in hair curve Sculpt Mode, profile will not be visible on new strands. This is due to bug in Blender - reported here . As a workaround use 'Set Radius' deformer with 'Build up' option disabled - to override haircard radius to 1. Fixed in Blender 4.2 You can't move vertices in curve Edit Mode, if 'Strands Overlay' is enabled. This is due to bug in Blender - reported [here] (https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/116763). Fixed in Blender 4.2 Undo won't work after editing curve radius in Curve Edit mode.

If you can't run the addon, \"auto-updater\" won't work. In that case you will have to download update manually I need to use old Blender For Blender 4.2+ - use Hair Tool 4.x + 'HairLibrary_4.x_date.zip' For Blender 3.6-4.1 - use Hair Tool 3.x, and HairLibrary_3.x_date.zip For Blender 3.3-3.6 - use Hair Tool. 2.46 (last version that supports 'old' curves), and HairLib_18_12_2022.zip Remove Old hair_tool folder sometimes old files from previous Hair Tool version may give trouble after update, if they are not removed (auto-updater deals with this automatically) Hair Tool folder is placed in your addons directory remove hair_tool folder from your ./addons/ directory restart Blender install Hair Tool again from zip file - this usually fixes installation problems Conflict with another add-ons If it still won't work, it is not often, but there may be conflict with another addon, or your blender setup may be corrupted. Try this: Restart Blender > then use File menu -> Defaults -> Load Factory Settings -> enable Hair Tool now. If Hair Tool works now, then it means, that your old config was corrupted, or there was conflict with another addon If above helped, then you may need to set up your blender config from scratch. Texture looks wrong \u00b6 Check if your hair material and UV_Data object are assigned correctly inside Profile section. Profile is place where material is assigned to hair strands., and hair UV shape (boxes) is stored If your UV_Data object is missing, you can create it by using Hair UV operator (or copy it from another object profile) Even if your UVs from (1) are assigned ok, you should check theirs shape in UV/Image Editor. Run Hair UV operator, and you should see UV Boxes/Regions similar this: Example of default hair UVs - made from five UV Regions (boxes) In your hair material: make sure that hair UVs are properly read from HTool_UV node and make sure that your image node is connected to it. When HTOOL_UV is linked to material output, it should have green+red tint Using Define UV to generate 'UV_Data` object will create UVs for hair, but it will not assign material to hair. For that you will need for that use UV Regions Distribute deformer (for procedural strands) or Set UV Regions operator (for 'real' strands). Sometimes UVs may not be generated correctly, if Profile node is out of date. Update it using 'Update Whole Profile' button from image below: Greyed out parameters panel \u00b6 Go to Preferences > System > Enable 'Global Undo'. You may need to restart blender after saving settings. It looks like blender bug, and from time to time this option is disabled for no reason. How do I export hair? \u00b6 Hair generated in Hair Tool can be exported just like any other mesh (File > Export > FBX). Just make sure to Convert Curves to Mesh hair first. How do I export hair texture? \u00b6 If you are using default Hair Tool hair material, then it is using just one texture - alpha mask. You can export it from UV Editor (or Image Editor) > Image menu > Save as: Note : Build-in HTool hair shader has complicated shader nodes setup, that allows them to look nice in Eevee. It is impossible to copy it to another game engines. If you want to create more complicated setup, with multiple texture types, you should use Hair Baking scene, where you can set up you hair and bake them as images to target directory. How do I animate Hair? \u00b6 There is no one way to animate hair, but usually I recommend using simple softbody mesh as deformer for actual hair like it is shown in video below: There is now built-in option to animate hair using Jiggle Bones see Animation Error when using Curves from Grid surface \u00b6 Make sure your source grid surface has proper topology. Examples of bad topology : Note : First mesh is bad, because it has no subdivision. The last torus does not have any border edge that could be used as marker for roots of hair. Examples of proper topology : Note : Torus is ok, as long as you break one of loops, to create border edge. How to assign UV to selected strand? \u00b6 For selected strands you can use Set UV region How do I change hair texture? \u00b6 To change hair texture you first need to identify which material Hair Profile is using. by default hair will receive material named HT_Defautl_Material Identify profile material, and open it in Shader editor (see yellow boxes below) Find texture node and change the hair texture, to any other image you want Remember to connect Vector input of texture node, to HTool_UV node - or texture won't be mapped correctly Note : HTool default texture uses: RGB channels for depth pass, A channel for opacity. If you want to use different texture, make sure it has similar channels setup (or use two - depth and opacity - textures). Note : If your texture layout is different, you may need to adjust UVs of Hair System . You can do it in UV Image Editor, by pressing Hair UV button see - Defining Hair UVs .

In that case you will have to download update manually I need to use old Blender For Blender 4.2+ - use Hair Tool 4.x + 'HairLibrary_4.x_date.zip' For Blender 3.6-4.1 - use Hair Tool 3.x, and HairLibrary_3.x_date.zip For Blender 3.3-3.6 - use Hair Tool. 2.46 (last version that supports 'old' curves), and HairLib_18_12_2022.zip Remove Old hair_tool folder sometimes old files from previous Hair Tool version may give trouble after update, if they are not removed (auto-updater deals with this automatically) Hair Tool folder is placed in your addons directory remove hair_tool folder from your ./addons/ directory restart Blender install Hair Tool again from zip file - this usually fixes installation problems Conflict with another add-ons If it still won't work, it is not often, but there may be conflict with another addon, or your blender setup may be corrupted. Try this: Restart Blender > then use File menu -> Defaults -> Load Factory Settings -> enable Hair Tool now.

Run Hair UV operator, and you should see UV Boxes/Regions similar this: Example of default hair UVs - made from five UV Regions (boxes) In your hair material: make sure that hair UVs are properly read from HTool_UV node and make sure that your image node is connected to it. When HTOOL_UV is linked to material output, it should have green+red tint Using Define UV to generate 'UV_Data` object will create UVs for hair, but it will not assign material to hair.

Useful for built-in Blender curve Hair rendering (controlled in 'Curves' Panel in Cycles/Eevee Render Settings) Parameters: Radius - blender strand radius - additional multiplier - on top of Set Radius deformer And for convenience, there are also Blender 'Curves' settings exposed in Hair Tool UI: Curves Shape - Strand or Strip Additional Subdivision - additional subdivision of hair strands in viewport Note : Blender curve profile wont render correctly, if Hair System is attached to mesh object. Use Ctrl+Shift+H -> Transfer Hair System -> To Empty Curve Flat Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Flat profile is what you will usually want to use to generate game Haircards Resolution - resolution along strand length (more segments, gives smoother look without having to add more points to hair curve) Profile Resolution - resolution of profile cross-section Width - hair-card width Width From UV - hair-card width will be linked to its UV region width. Use Random UV Flip - randomly flip UVs in X axis Your browser does not support the video tag. Taper UVs by Radius - will taper hair-card UVs, based on hair-card taper Curve Profile \u00b6 Curve Profile - (with UV's) - any curve object can be used as custom hair profile - just like in old Blender curves. Multi Curve Profile \u00b6 New in Hair Tool 4.0. On image above we used: C , X and < shaped curve objects (visible at top) as profile shapes for strands generated on guide grid mesh Multi Curve Profile unlocks ability to assign unique curve profile shape for each hair strand. Use the Profile Distribute deformer (for procedurally generated strands) or Set Profile ID operator (for 'real' hair curves) to assign profile object to each strand. This unlocks possibility to use cross profiles (technique used in Horizon Zero Dawn). Your browser does not support the video tag. Above I show how to generate and instance multiple curves along hairstrands (video is narrated) Use Strand UVs for singular cards option allows you to use hair strand UVs (rather than profile UVs) for profile curves made from single spline. UVs will work in similar way to how Flat Profile UVs work - use UV Region Distribute deformer and Set UV Region operator to distribute UVs onto hair curves. Note : Fastest way to generate curve profile objects is to use Generate Curves from UV button (close to the bottom of Profile panel) Note : to define which strand will receive which profile object use Distribute Profile deformer Round Profile. \u00b6 It is only needed in hair texture baking setup. It does not support UV mapping, so it is not suitable for Haircards rendering Circle Profile \u00b6 Simple Circle profile - it supports UV mapping. Width - hair-card width Resolution - resolution along strand length (more segments, gives smoother look without having to add more points to hair curve) Profile Resolution - resolution of profile cross-section Braid Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In demo above you can see both curve taper and tilt is affecting the generated braids shape Global Scale - default value 1.0 is good for default cube (2 meters in size).

Hair System is located in Right Sidebar \u2192 Hair Tool Tab \u2192 Hair System Panel. Click [+] to add Hair System to selected mesh or curve object. On image above we have Two Hair Systems named: Parent , Child . You can see Child system is made from: Strand Generator, Noise, Clump, Set Radius etc. deformers. Whole system is guided by: HairCurve guide - second input at very top Strands generated with Hair Systems are then passed to hair profile generation system, which convert these strands to hair-cards.

Transfer Hair System \u00b6 Hair System can be assigned to Mesh or Curve Hair object, depending on which object is selected when you add Hair System. If you want to change Hair System 'owner' you can use Transfer Hair System operator. Hair System that generates hair-cards (in center above) can be assigned to: Source/Base Mesh mesh from which strands are spawned from (often scalp mesh) Empty Mesh helper, without geometry, usually linked with Source Mesh and Guide Curve Guide Curve curve object that guides strands Empty Curve helper, without geometry, (usually linked with Source Mesh and Guide Curve) Hair system transfer possibilities: Current Owner Transfer To Result Guide Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Guide Curve Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to new, empty mesh object Empty Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Base Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Base Mesh Empty Curve Hair System will be moved to Empty Curve Hair object Base Mesh Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to Empty Mesh object Empty Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Empty Mesh Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Visually, there should not be any noticeable difference. However, the owner of the Hair System will change User cases when you want to use Transfer Hair System: if you want to 'Bake' curves generated by Hair System to curve, but it is assigned to Mesh (meshes cannot receive curves geometry). In that case you can transfer Hair System to Empty Curve, and then bake it to it if hair interpolation is broken (e.g. stops working after you select and try to sculpt Guide Curve.

This works only on hair curve type of objects (try: Ctr+Shift+H > Transfer Hair System: to Empty Curve, or to Guide Curve) Transfer Hair System - explained here Sub-Systems Types \u00b6 After adding a Hair Sub-System, you'll see the first slot in the deformer stack is added automatically. This is determined by the selected hair sub-system type. Strands Generator \u00b6 It will grow strands, from Base Mesh surface. You can control parameters like: resolution, density, length, interpolation ( Parent Child relation must be set ) etc. These strands are affected by all subsequent deformers in current system stack Your browser does not support the video tag. Set parent Tags and enable interplation option, so that generated strands will follow these Tagged strands. See Child Parent Setup Align to Surface Normal \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Align to Surface Normal - option changes how the interplation works. Do not confuse with Align Tilt To Source Surface Strands Distribution \u00b6 Poisson distribution is a better way to spread things out evenly than just randomly placing them. Here's why: Imagine you're trying to place hair strands on a surface. Random placement: You might end up with clumps of hair in some areas and gaps in others. Poisson distribution: This method makes sure the hair is spread out more evenly. It does this by removing any hair strands that are too close together. Left : notice the clumping of hair roots; Center : Poisson distribution helps to remove these clumped dots (colored in black), by removing roots that are closer than Min Distance parameter. Right : Increase Density parameter to fill up the empty spots Strands Filter \u00b6 This hair (sub)System type lets you affect existing hair strands - whether these strands are: 'real' (for example generated with Hair Drawing ), or generated procedurally by another Hair subSystem > Strands Generator . This way you can e.g. add Noise effect to all existing strands (or make them curl, taper etc). There is option to affect only selected strands, by filtering them with TAGs . Imagine you want to modify two Hair Systems, by adding Set Radius or Align Tilt . Instead of applying these deformers to each individual Hair subSystem, you can utilize the Filter System to affect all strands simultaneously . Your browser does not support the video tag. Demo of applying 'Scale' deformer to strands generated with Right Tag Note : If no filter tag is specified, then all strands will be affected Strands From Grid Surface \u00b6 This type of Strand Generator, will guide strands using guide mesh (grid mesh, made of quads only). Root of strands will be placed: on edge loop marked as Sharp (Ctrl+E -> Mark Sharp) or on crease edge (Shift+E -> Crease Edge). These strands can be affected by all subsequent deformers in current system stack Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above - top, boundary edge loop was marked as sharp Note : Notice how guide grid, in video above, has uneven topology - getting dense to the right. This is important when adjusting 'Uniform Spacing' option Note : To mask-out placement of roots, just plugin in vertex group mask into 'Placement Mask' input Examples of proper grid guide topology : Check out the FAQ to see examples of wrong mesh topology Interpolated Strands \u00b6 This Strand Generator, will use existing curves add extra strands in between them. In that case order of strand matter! Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above I used drawn strands to guide the 'Interpolated Strands' generator (video is narrated) Note : If order of your strands is wrong, and Automatic Spline Sorting option fails, you can use Sort Strands by Stroke operator to manually fix the order (see video above) Child - Parent setup \u00b6 Linking two Hair SubSystems, with Child-Parent relation, enables capabilities such as: interpolation, clumping, curls, braids, twist and others. Use Tags to link two Hair SubSystems , establishing a parent-child relationship. Your browser does not support the video tag. In the video above, I show how to make the red strands (called \"ParentSys\") the parent (guide) for the yellow strands (named \"Child\"). You can use any tag name you want. In this example, I used \"RED\". Note : Parent Hair System has to be placed above Child System in the stack, or else Child strands won't 'see' the Parent strands Hair Interpolation \u00b6 To enable hair interpolation, current Hair System has to have parent - see above . After that Toggle Interpolation button will be accessible (enabled by default) in first deformer - Strands Generator properties Note : In some cases interpolation may behave erratically (e.g interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). The most likely cause is - cyclic dependency: - Guide curve depends on your base mesh (usually scalp), - Base Mesh (with Hair System attached) depends on guide curve (through enabled interpolation to Parent - Guide Curve). To fix it and break the cyclic dependency use Transfer Hair System and move Hair System to either Empty Mesh or Guide Curve. Since Hair Tool 3.0 and later versions, strands interpolation operates within areas surrounded by mesh islands - meaning, if you want to make hairstyle with split: split scalp mesh in two, without separating to new object, (e.g. select edge loop, that divides the scalp in half - and press 'V' to rip it). Now child strands will not cross this edge. Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above I have cut mesh in 4 parts (visualised with 4 colors). Strands won't cross islands boundaries Note : If you want to make hairstyle with split, you can use Select By Island to select guide strands from specific island Note : instead of splitting the edges physically, you can use the Edges split modifier Hair sub-System menu \u00b6 You can copy settings from any hair system, and paste to target using entries above. Bake \u00b6 Procedurally generated strands cannot be groomed. First convert them into 'real' geometry with 'Bake' operator. This will bake: active (and preceding) Hair sub-Systems or All Hair sub-systems into 'real' curve geometry, that can then be groomed using Blender 'Curve Sculpt' mode. Note : Baking works only if Hair System is attached to hair curve type of objects! If not the use: Ctr+Shift+H > Transfer Hair System > to Empty Curve or to Guide Curve) Your browser does not support the video tag. Curves in video cannot be groomed, since they are generated procedurally. After baking, you can groom them without issues Update Node Pack \u00b6 Update selected Hair Components (geometry node setup) to its latest version, for example after updating add-on Copy/Paste Hair System \u00b6 Copy Hair System settings from: Active Hair sub-System or All sub-Systems Paste Hair System settings to: Active Hair sub-System or to All sub-Systems Your browser does not support the video tag. Copying All SubSystems (and profile settings) from one object to another. Receiving object has to have at least one Hair subSystem attached. Also make sure both objects share same vertex groups, similar sharp (or crease) edges - if you copy Curves From Grid type of setup Switch Hair System Type \u00b6 Switch Hair System Type - for example from Strands Generator to Strands Filter. Pasting Hair System settings (or instancing object that uses Hair System), will create linked copy. This means that change performed on new copy, will affect original Hair subSystem too. Number of Hair System users is displayed next to Hair Tag (green box in image above) Note: You can unlink Hair System, by clicking on 'users number' (see green box above) Tags \u00b6 Think of Tags as labels we apply to the strands in a Hair System. They enable us to establish child-parent relations or manipulate specific strands with strands filter . Why won't we use system name for that functionality? The reason is, that you can assign multiple tags to same strand e.g.: Hair System A strands Tags: LONG and CURLY . Hair System B strands Tags: LONG Now you can modify strands tagged with LONG label - using Strands Filter , without having to create same deformers on Hair System A then B twice. Tags can be also assigned to subset of strands from within Hair System with Assign Tag deformer. In image above we tagged 'First' Hair System A with label. 'Second' and 'Third' system are linked to it - which allows us to use e.g. interpolation on them. Note: Guide curves received GUIDE tag automatically Tag can be assigned in few ways: by typing it in next to system name see A tag in image above. If system has no tag assigned then [TAG] label is shown by using Assign Tag deformer you can also assign tags to Hair System guide object (new Curve Hair) using Tags Panel . See Below Tags Panel \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above we create Tag A , then assign selected curves to tag A using Assign button Note : Assigning Tags only works on new Hair Curves. To be able to select individual curves, like in video above, you have to use Hair Modeling mode . For now only selection works from all the available Modeling Tools Hair Deformers \u00b6 Deformers gives you ability change chair look - add noise to hair, make them curl, snap to surface etc. They are stacked one on top of each other in similar way than Blender modifiers. They can be reordered. Some deformers (e.g. clump, twist, braids) will only work, if Hair System, to which deformers belong to is Set as Child Animation \u00b6 Attach Curves UV \u00b6 Attach strands roots to source mesh UVs, without it animation of hair with 'Surface Deform' modifier will not work. Bake/Cache Hair \u00b6 Save hair strands into cached memory. They will no longer be editable, but will be faster to animate, since they will not be re-generated on every frame change. Surface Deform \u00b6 Same as blender built-in modifier. Allows hair to follow source mesh deformation (by rig or shape keys). Note : You may want to use Bake deformer first, so that strands will not be regenerated on every frame Physics \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can add collision objects, control: wind, gravity, damping etc. Not perfect yet, but can give some nice results. For more advanced physics simulation we may need to wait for native blender geo-nodes physics integration. Note : You may want to use Bake deformer first, so that strands will not be regenerated on every frame Note : If you notice some jittering, try reducing gravity and increasing damping. For now self collisions are disabled, since you would have to subdivide strands a lot, to get good results. Long hair simulation may not look the best. But at least new HTool 4.x physics does not exploade like it used to in HT 3.x Assign Group ID \u00b6 Assign Group ID attribute to strands. After baking hair system you can use this to select strands by group ID. Braids (Child) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clump child strands to Guide/Parent strands (FIRST tag) in shape of Braids. Set Hair System as child first Color Set (System) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. It will alow your to colorize haircards generated inside current hair system (added mostly for debugging hair sub-systems setups) Clumps (Child) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clumps child strands toward parent strands. Set Hair System as child first Curls \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clump child strands to Guide/Parent strands (FIRST tag) in shape of Curls. Can be used with Hair System as child first Generators \u00b6 Duplicate Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Simple duplication of exisitng strands Braid Generator \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Each strand will be duplicated 2 times (3 strands with original one), and braided together. Works best with 'Circular' Profile The Idea in above video is: Take single strand, and convert it to 3 braided ones with 'Braid Generator' Duplicate each sub-strand few times with Duplicate Strands deformer Add some randomization with Noise deformer and UV Region Distribute deformer This should make it more volumetric looking, since braid will be made from multiple textured haircards, rather than single one. Instance on Strand \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Instance any mesh on hair Strands (can be used to eg. add tie and tail on the end of braid) - since HTool 2.44 Mirror \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Mirror hair, with optional option of bisect (remove one half of hair first, then mirror the remaining part) Move in/out of Surface \u00b6 Embed Roots \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Helps to push hair roots into surface. Best to used before Align Tilt deformer, since it can lead to haircard twisting Push Out \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Push hair outside surface. Useful when wanting to push out layer of hair or to prevent hair clipping through character geometry Attach To Surface \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Attach hair to surface. Useful when wanting to 'glue' hair to character geometry (scalp) Move to Border \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In the video above, a source mesh is created using two half-sphere meshes. We use the \"Move to Border\" deformer to move the strands to the edge of this mesh. Then, we apply the 'Track To Mesh' deformer, to clump tips of strands together Snap \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Snap hair to source surface (could be used for wet hair effect) Lengthen \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Lenghtens hair strands. Unlike simple scale - it will make hair extend from the tips Noise \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Add noise distortion to strands Radius Set \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Set Radius - for hair tapering, strand width randomization, etc. Can also guide Curls amplitude or Braid size - for child Hair Systems Roll Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Basically the same as blender build-in Roll Scale \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Scale hair up or down. With trim deformer we can reduce length of hair, but Scale deformer helps to make them longer. Simplify Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Resamples strands - assigning lower points count to shorter strands Slide Points \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Give more resolution to hair root or tips (depending on 'Influence Range'), by 'sliding' points along the curves Smooth Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Smooth out the strands Tag \u00b6 Assign Tag \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Here we assign R tag to right side of head (masking it with vertex group). Then in 'Scale' Hair System that is set to Strands Filter we resize these tagged strands with Scale deformer Note : Assigning any tag e.g. X will create negative tag 'X, for example if we create tag RIGHT with some strands, then tag 'RIGHT will contain opposite set of strands. Delete Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Simple delete strands operation based on their Tag. In video above I removed strands tagged as R then GUIDE strands (bit hard too see, since they are covered by other strands) Tilt \u00b6 Add Tilt \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Add tilt to hair strands. If 'Flip Probability' is 0.5 - then half strands will be rotated clockwise and half counter clockwise Align Tilt \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Aligns tilt to hair source surface (hair normal will point outside of surface) Align Tilt to Parent \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Aligns tilt to Parent (Guide) strands. Hair card backfaces are shown in blue. Great for Dragon Ball hairstyle :) Align Tilt to Target \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Aligns tilt to target surface (hair normal will point outside of target surface) Align Tilt to Mesh Border \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Align strands tilt to border of source surface (usually scalp). Backfaces are shown in blue Force Align if checked, it will align curve and force curve normal to point outside border edge. If unchecked, tilt will be aligned to border, but curve normal will point with the 'flow' - see video above. Track To: \u00b6 Track to Mesh \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Track to Mesh - Strands from closes mesh island will follow tracked mesh object. Use Bind button to prevets hair tips from 'sliding' on mesh surface Note : Closest affected island is determined by Tracked object origin. Move it to change which island will be affected. After finding desired island, you can move tracked object in edit mode, so that affected strands won't change. Note : If you want to 'Freeze' tracked points, use 'Bind Tracked Mesh' button. Now strands will follow point at which they were bound, rather than sliding around mesh surface. Track to Curve \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Track to Curve - Strands from closes mesh island will follow tracked curve object. Use Bind button to prevets hair tips from 'sliding' on tracked surface surface Note : Closest affected island is determined by Tracked object origin. Move it to change which island will be affected. After finding desired island, you can move tracked object in edit mode, so that affected strands won't change. Note : If you want to 'Freeze' tracked points, use 'Bind Tracked Curve' button (this will convert 'old' curve to 'new' type). Now strands will follow point at which they were bound, rather than sliding around curve surface. Note : Curve Shape Keys are great addition to Track To Curve deformer. Trim \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. It will shorten strands roots and/or tips. Best to use with randomization mask Twist \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Twist effect requires to set Hair System to be set as child . For best effect is is good idea to place it after Clump deformer Profile Distribute \u00b6 Mesh Profile or Multi Curve Profile holds profile objects list for instancing on strands, but it does not tell which strand will receive which profile object. This is where 'Profile Distribute' deformer comes in. It will tell which strand will receive which profile object, based 'Profile_ID' attribute, assigned to each strand. Your browser does not support the video tag. You can use multiple 'Profile Distribute' Deformers, and stack them on top of each other (think of them as layers). In video above, I used RED and GREEN profile objects as base layer, then added PURPLE on top - masked by vertex group UV Region Distribute \u00b6 Hair Profile holds UV Boxes/Regions amount and dimensions, but it does not tell which strand will receive which UV Region. This is where 'UV Region Distribute' deformer comes in - it will assign random (or masked) UV Region to each strand. Note : use multiple 'UV Region Distribute' deformers + Input Masks , to achieve layered UVs effect (see video below), Your browser does not support the video tag. Example use of multiple 'UV Regions Distribute' Deformers, to stack them on top of each other (as layers). Region ID_2 as base layer + Region ID_0 on top - masked by vertex group Note : UV Region Distribute is often created automatically when hair system is added Input Masks \u00b6 You can mask most of the hair deformers inputs with various kind of effects. Multiple masks can be added. Note : The order matters: first top mask is evaluated then next to the bottom Your browser does not support the video tag. To add mask click drop down menu icon on right and pick mask type Border Edge Distance \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Border Edge Distance : mask an effect based on strands distance to border of source mesh. Above we used Align Tilt to Mesh Border deformer, to align tilt only on strands that are closest to mesh border. It has invert option too. Curve Attribute \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Curve Attribute : Use Curve attribute to mask hair effect. This is intended to be used with Edit Curve Attribute feature in HTool Vertex Group/Texture \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Vertex Group/Texture : Use vertex group or texture for input masking Object Vertex Group/Texture \u00b6 Same as above, but samples vertex group/texture from custom object Radius Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Radius Mask : Mask an effect based on strand radius. In video above I reduced noise on braids, at thinner places. Offset/Gain \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Mask Offset Gain : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it can increase the mask contrast (gain) or brightness (offset) Invert \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Invert : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it will invert the previous mask effect Randomize \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Randomize : Outputs random value for each strand. Random value will be picked from within [x-RandRange; x+RandRange] bounds, where x - is any input value - e.g. from vertex group mask You can disable lower/upper bound using < / > buttons, thus limiting Random value range. Rand Range - 0 - no randomization; 1 - maximum randomization Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly smaller values, from within given range, Variance == 0.5 all random values are drawn uniformly, from within given range, Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly bigger values, from within given range, Use Parent IDs - if enabled each child strand will inherit random value from its closest parent. Length Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Assigns Min value to the shortest strands, Assigns Max value to the longest strands. Swapping Min and Max values will invert the effect Procedural Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Procedural Mask : Use procedural noise texture to randomize hair look. No need for UVs Min, Max - bring these values closer together to get sharper noise transition, Scale - the bigger scale the more detailed the texture will be, Distort - distorts the noise, Offset - offset the noise sampling position Influence Range \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Special mask that allows to modulate influence of deformer over strand length (e.g. taper only tip of strand). 0 - no effect, 1 - maximum effect Types of Influence range masks: Constant - the effect is uniform along the whole strand length Simple - gradually changes the influence from 0 to 100%. Influence can be flipped using invert button Quadratic - gives more detailed control: modulate effect independently at strand beginning, center and end Profile Curve - most detailed control using profile curve Updating \u00b6 After updating Hair Tool add-on, you may need to update your Hair Setup: There is option to update Individual Hair System elements (Deformers, Masks, Profiles etc.) - located in Deformers dropdown menu Setup and Profile node (green and blue box on image below) Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene. Be warned though: add-on will try to recreate whole node tree structure from scratch, so this may now always work. You may update deformer, profile, mask etc. nodes using menu above Note :: Using individual node packs update (only Deformers, or only Masks etc.) method is usually safer. Limitations \u00b6 Only One UV box can be assigned to profile - you can use Mesh Profile with multiple meshes as a workaround for randomizing UVs (No longer the case Since HT 2.44) Hair Modeling Tools do not work (except selection) Hair interpolation is using booleans under the hood. Because of this, interpolation may fail if boolean fails. And Interpolation may be slow on heavy base meshes (I recommend using lowpoly hair surface meshes). Hopefully I will find better way in the future, to create interpolations. (No longer the case since Blender 3.5 and Hair Tool 2.44) FAQ \u00b6 I get Errors in console \u00b6 If you open old blend file with old Hair Tool setup, after you updated Hair Tool, you may get some errors, and UI wont be drawn correctly. Use Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene Warning this is potentially destructive operation, since whole node tree will be recreated from scratch. Updated nodes behavior may change, resulting in slightly different hair look Hair Interpolation won't work \u00b6 In some cases interpolation may behave erratically (e.g interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). The most likely cause is - cyclic dependency between Base Mesh with attached Hair System and Guide Curve. See note in Hair Iterpolation section. To fix the cyclic dependency use Transfer Hair System and move Hair System to either: Empty Mesh or Guide Curve.","title":"Hair System"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#hair-system","text":"","title":"Hair System"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#overview","text":"Hair System assists you in creating procedural hair strands in a non-destructive way, utilizing Blender's Geometry Nodes technology.

Strands won't cross islands boundaries Note : If you want to make hairstyle with split, you can use Select By Island to select guide strands from specific island Note : instead of splitting the edges physically, you can use the Edges split modifier","title":"Hair Interpolation"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#hair-sub-system-menu","text":"You can copy settings from any hair system, and paste to target using entries above.","title":"Hair sub-System menu"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#bake","text":"Procedurally generated strands cannot be groomed.

In this modeling technique we are instancing haircards on mesh edges (haircard count will be the same as character mesh edges count). Useful for creation of fur. Note Short Hair modeling requires Blender 3.3 or above. Example of 'Short hair' by Ellinor Mor\u00e9n The main advantages: easy to setup - one click solution easy to tweak with blender sculpting tools (or with poly modeling) haircards distribution based on source character mesh topology - you will automatically get denser hair in more important areas: head, hands (but this can be con - depending on situation) The main cons: no easy way to control density - since density is based on source character mesh topology (you cant drive it with e.g. vertex group) hair source mesh has to have same topology as hair guide mesh. This mean you may have to start combing from scratch if change base mesh topology (but there is workaround I will show later) Note : You can tweak haircards density by changing base mesh topology - eg. by using remesh modifier or adaptive tessellation in blender sculpt mode. How To use \u00b6 Select your character. Let's assume it is named: Body Use Ctrl+Shift+H menu -> 'Setup Short Hair' Alternatively you can use: right sidebar (N key) -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel -> 'Setup Short Hair' Two new objects will be added: Body_short_hair (hair object) and Body_hair_guide (drawn as bounding box) Select hair guide object (bounding box) and go into sculpt mode that is it, you can now sculpt hair by sculpting guide mesh (polygonal modeling can be used too) Note To finalize Short hair use 'Convert Short Hair to Mesh' from Hair Tool Ctrl+Shift+H menu. This will correctly tranfser UVs from modifier to mesh data Remeshing Modes: \u00b6 When you use 'Setup Short Hair' operator, you will have option to remesh base geometry (or leave it as it is). Since haircards are spawned on each mesh edge, then source mesh topology has big influence on Short Hair look Three main modes of remeshing starting from left: Diamonds, Triangulated Diamonds, Triangulated Cells Base Suzanne is made from around 1000 edges. Meaning Short Hair will spawn 1000 haircards (planes or ribbons) Diamond Topology will create 2000 edges Diamond Triangulated will create 3000 edges Triangulated Cells will output 4600 edges! Cells remeshing - gives highest poly-count but the resulting topology is organic and thanks to this haircards will also be distributed in natural way. Diamonds topology, on the other hand, has visible repeating pattern and it may show through on generated haircards. Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Example of Short Hair generated with Triangulated Diamonds Remeshing Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh Defining UVs \u00b6 UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs. Select Short Hair object open UV Image Editor and press \u2018Hair UV\u2019 button located in top header bar - on far right then draw UV boxes like it is shown in Defining UVs . The only difference, compared to curves, is that UV mirroring is automatically enabled. Uv Region defined above can be distributed/assigned to hair-cards in two ways - using Vertex Groups as UV mask, or manually. Manual UV assignment \u00b6 You can manually select mesh parts and assign uv regions to it Set UV Region : Your browser does not support the video tag. Assigning UV Region with ID: 1 to selected edges Select Short Hair object, and go into Edit Mode (using Tab key) Select edges for which you want to assign new UV regions Use Ctrl + Shift + H menu -> Set UV Region , and pick UVs that you want to assign to selection. Short Hair Cards generated at these edges will receive new UVs. Set UVs using Vertex Groups \u00b6 Semi-automatic way of assigning UVs using Vertex groups (access from right Sidebar -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel) We have [L]eft and [R]ight vertex groups. We can use these to assign different UV regions With above setup, UV_1 region will be assigned to hair-cards on [L]eft, and UV_2 region on [R]ight Note : First entry (Base UV) in vert Group layers is always used as 'Background' layer - meaning UV regions assigned to it, will be distributed on whole character body. Following vertex groups will cover this base layer, with theirs own UV regions. Parameters: \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can change Short Hair parameters by going into modifiers tab. Use Guide Object - You may want to use the modifier without Hair Guide object. This boolean parameter helps to turn off Guide object, without breaking modifier behavior Your browser does not support the video tag. Guide Object - Haircards will follow Guide Object deformations. It does not matter if you modify Deformer object in sculpt mode or in Edit mode, but you can't change Deformer object topology .

Noise - Helps to break the even look of haircards Coloring Strands \u00b6 Short Hair cards can be colored using vertex color or texture from character body.

Generating Short Hair from that should give uniform look I need denser hair \u00b6 There is no way to control Short Hair density. But you can add subdivision modifier to increase the density. This will however bump up haircards count Four Times, for each subdivision. Note 1 You have to add subdivision modifier to both Body (above Short Hair mod), and Hair Deformer object or Short Hair won't work correctly.
