To use auto updater go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Hair Tool -> press Check for update . In new version is found, press Update addon button, wait few seconds and restart blender. Note: To avoid constant email notification update spam, I publish smaller updates/bugfixes without version number bump. Only after implementing enough of new features/bugfixes publish official new version with increased release number. If you want go grab 'smaller' bugfixes, but addon shows, that you already have the latest version, use Reinstall Current Version . It will download these smaller incremental bugfixes. You can also download updates manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased Hair Tool. Note: It seems auto-updater does not work on Mac OS. As a Mac user you will have to download update manually from Gumroad account. Now it should work on Mac too.

Hair System to mesh haircards You can also generate: Braids Curly hair . Curve ribbons to mesh ribbons \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Ribbon to Curves/ Curves to Ribbon - allow for switching between curve ribbons and mesh ribbons. Usually you will do the hair modeling in curve mode, and then, on export, convert them to mesh. This operator ensures that curves UVs are properly converted to mesh UVs. Finalize Hair \u00b6 When you want to export your character with hair usually you would have to: Convert curve hair to mesh hair Join mesh hair with character body (it is destructive operation, so usually you would create copies each object before joining the duplicates) finally export merged-duplicated object Finalize Hair is doing all of above (except exporting) in one step. Just select curve hair (or mesh hair), your character object an run 'Finalize hair' to get merged copy that is ready to export. You can remove exported duplicated object after that. Particle Hairs to Curve \u00b6 Particle Hairs to Curve - generate curve ribbons from Particle hair. Align their tilt to head with 'Align Tilt' checkbox, and embed hair roots deeper into the scull using 'Embed Roots' parameter. Particle Hairs From Curve \u00b6 Particle Hair from Curves (this can be used to convert zbrush fibermesh to blender Particle Hair system). Select curves and target mesh (that will receive Particle Hair) and use ' Particle Hair from Curves ' to convert curves object to blenders Hair system. Generate Braids \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. To generate Braids - select one or more splines from curve object, and run 'Generate Braid'. You can access operator properties from F9 hotkey. After finishing operation, originally selected splines will be separated - each into its own object, and they will deform the generated braid. This way you will be able to twist (ctrl +T), scale radius (alt+s) or move generated braids. Note : If you want to adjust braid later on - just re-run braid operator, while having braid object selected. Parameters: (F9 Key) Points per interlace - Amount of points per braid interlace. Length - braid length multiplier (actual length is calculated from selected spline length) Frequency - Frequency describes how many times hair strand interlacing will occur Main Radius - Overall braid radius Strand Radius - Individual strands radius Radius falloff - Change braid size over strand length (tapers the braid on the tip) Equalize radii - Equalize radii for braids with different lengths (when generating multiple braids) Generate Curly hair \u00b6 To generate Curls - select one or more splines from curve object, and run 'Generate Curls'. You can access operator properties from F9 hotkey. After finishing operation, originally selected splines will be separated - each into its own object, and they will deform the generated braid. Parameters: (F9 Key) Points per cycle - Amount of points per curl cycle.

It is impossible to copy it to another game engines. If you want to create more complicated setup, with multiple texture types, you should use Hair Baking scene, where you can set up you hair and bake them as images to target directory.

Hair Tool give you easy option, to generate bones and weight paint data for your hair cards. You can animate generated bones using simple jiggle physics. Note : This only works on mesh hair (there is no way to rig curves in blender). Bones Setup \u00b6 To create bones for selected mesh strands (islands): convert curve hair to mesh using Curves to Mesh In mesh edit mode select hair strands (mesh islands) that you want to animate. Open Hair Tool Pie menu using Ctrl+Shift+H -> select 'Generate Bones' now you can tweak option for bone generation (bones count, starting position, etc) If you already have armature object assigned to your character it is recommended that you point Hair Tool to it by setting 'Target Rig' property. With that, generated bones will be automatically assigned to your character rig. Also remember to setup 'Pin bone' - this bone will be automatically set as parent for generated hair bone chains. Usually character 'head' bone can be used as 'pin bone' (hair bones parent) Bones Setup - parameters \u00b6 Bones Start - Place first bone at some start distance from strand root location Offset To Tip - Bunch up generated bones more toward strand tip Assign jiggle - Assign jiggle physics to generated bones Bones Count - Bones Count Bones Generation Mode - Generate separate bone chain for each selected mesh strand, or generate only one chain for mesh island with active face/edge/face (other selected islands will use active chain for skining - good for clumps) Jiggle Physics Setup \u00b6 If you enabled ' Assign Jiggle ' when creating bones, then HT will automatically add jiggle physics to new bones. You can edit jiggle physics in armature POSE MODE : change time step add collision to selected bones (other bones will bounce from collision bone) create jiggle physics presets (with various mass, stiffness, damping, gravity parameters) and assign these presets to selected bones Simulation Mode \u00b6 Jiggle Physics can be run in two Modes: Interactive - good for mouse interaction with jiggle bones, but it won't work when rendering animation Animated - only works when animation playback is enabled. Useful when rendering animation. There is also option to bake jiggle sim into animation using those steps Physics presets \u00b6 You can create multiple physics presets in Hair Tool using [+] icon. Your browser does not support the video tag. To assign physics preset to bones: select target bones open triangle menu and select 'Assign jiggle to bones' you can remove selected bones from preset using same menu Note : If you have any bones selected when creating new physics preset, then those bones will be automatically assigned to new physics preset. Baking Jiggle Animation \u00b6 Jiggle physics can be baked to animation using following steps: select jiggle bones object mode > animation > bake action, with these settings: only selected bones visual keying overwrite current action bake bones (not object) Don't forget to turn simulation off after baking BEFORE rendering, or you will get unexpected results.

As a result if you have two curve hair objects sharing same material , they both will share same UV too. If you wan to separate UVs, then you have to separate (un-instance) material on both curves. If you want two curves to have same UV - just link Material from one to the other. Here is video explaining material creation Optimal UV workflow \u00b6 The optimal workflow for creation an assigning hair UVs (UVs are stored in hairs material): Select curve hair object Define UV regions like shown in Defining UVs . This will create hair materials that holds UV data Manually assign UV's boxes to selected strands with Set UV region Link materials (that hold UV's) created in second step, to other hair object and repeat third step Note1: Do not use Blender's buildin 'Convert-To->Mesh' operator on curve hair, or your output mesh UVs will be messed up. Instead use Curve ribbons to mesh ribbons . This way curve Material UVs will be properly, converted to mesh UVs. Defining UV's \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Defining UV regions in Hair Tool from UV image editor How to create curve hair UVs: open UV Image Editor and press \u2018 Hair UV \u2019 button located in top header bar - on far right next use Left Click and drag rectangular shape, to define the UV bounds for texture mapping. You can drag corners of existing UV box to adjust its shape. To remove UV box, hover your mouse over one of uv boxes and press [Delete] key To reset UV press Shift + Delete Each UV box will create one material. So if you made 5 UV boxes, then addon will create 5 materials (times two if you have enabled 'Random UV flip' in addon preferences). Note1: 'Random UV flip' option in addon preferences, will create additional X-axis mirrored UVs, that can be randomly assigned to hair strands. This doubles material count Note2: If you want to flip strand texture in Y direction, just hover your mouse over UV box and press 'F'! Offset UV \u00b6 It moves UV points more toward the root or tip on hair strand. As a result you can stretch UVs and change texture look. See video below: Your browser does not support the video tag. To use UV Offset just hover you mouse over UV box and scroll with MMB. Material / UV Refresh \u00b6 Hair Tool is assigning multiple materials to hair curve object, as workaround for lack of UV re-mapping on curves. However, if you want to change hair material you would have to: - modify first material slot - then manually change all remaining material slots one by one. This is where 'Material / UV Refresh' comes to rescue. Changes done to first material slot, will be automatically propagated to remaining material slot when you use 'Material / UV Refresh'. Material / UV Refresh with random seed option. It changes random hair strands materials assignment Set UV region \u00b6 Map selected strands UV to specific uv box by its ID number Note : UV box ID numbers can be previewed using 'Hair UV' button see: Defining UVs In Hair Tool UV is stored in material data. This means if you made three UV boxes then addon will create/assign three materials to selected object (if you enabled 'Random UV flip' in addons preferences, then mat count is doubled). Those three materials (UV boxes), can be assigned to each curve strand using 'Set UV region' Note : you can assign material slots to hair strands manually using Blender's build-in 'Assign' button from Material Tab, but 'Set UV region' provides additional randomization option - where selected strands will randomly pick one of selected UV boxes IDs. Your browser does not support the video tag. Set selected strands UV to one of three, user defined, UV boxes by using theirs IDs.

We can also assign UV/Material based on strands length with 'Length masked Uvs' Hair UV Curls \u00b6 This option allows creating low-poly curly hair effect on hair objects that have round profile (resulting in pipe like curves). Curly UV's settings are stored in material, thus each material can have unique curls look. On the other hand if your hair have one material, then all curls will look exactly the same on all splines. Your browser does not support the video tag. We can assign UV curls for individual UV regions one by one. Or shift select multiple IDs to assign UV Curls to multiple regions (with optional randomization - by setting min range value) In the above video I used two UV Regions, thus we get two materials (plus additional two for the mirrored UV). So in total we get four unique curls looks. Default Hair Material \u00b6 Hair Tool has build in hair shader, great for realtime preview in EEVEE.

Hair System is made from: Hair Generator (or Filter) , followed by list ( Deformers ), that you can put on top of each other and slowly build up complexity over time. Hair Systems in stack can be linked together with usage of Tags - this help to describe which Hair System is affecting which strands. Hair System is located in Right Sidebar \u2192 Hair Tool Tab \u2192 Hair System Panel. Click [+] to add Hair System to selected mesh or curve object. On image above we have Two Hair Systems named: Parent , Child . You can see Child system is made from: Strand Generator, Noise, Clump, Set Radius etc. deformers. Whole system is guided by: HairCurve guide - second input at very top Strands generated with Hair Systems are then passed to hair profile generation system, which convert these strands to hair-cards. Hair Setup \u00b6 Below I show you demo of how to setup game ready hair in 1 minute : Your browser does not support the video tag. Full setup - starting from scalp mesh and hair curves, and ending with mesh haircards Description of steps: Adding Hair System to selected curve hair object (Hair System can be assigned to mesh or curve object - one is required, but you need both to get full functionality) Note : If you assigned Hair System to curve, then you won't be able to convert it to mesh. In that case use Transfer Hair System option. Reducing Profile width (Flat curve profile is automatically assigned to new Hair System) Bumping up strands density to 8888 Adding Deformers: Align Tilt - it will force hair cards to face scalp surface Set Radius - it will taper the haircards Import hair material: Ctrl+Shift+H \u2192 Import Default Hair Material (with default UVs) We have to move hair system to mesh (see step 1 note): Ctrl+Shift+H \u2192 Transfer Hair System \u2192 To Empty mesh Ctrl+Shift+H \u2192 Convert Hair System to mesh (or you can use Finalize , to create mesh copy of HSystem) That is it, you can now export generated mesh to Game Transfer Hair System \u00b6 Hair System can be assigned to Mesh or Curve Hair object, depending on which object is selected when you add Hair System. If you want to change Hair System 'owner' you can use Transfer Hair System operator. Hair System that generates hair-cards (in center above) can be assigned to: Source/Base Mesh mesh from which strands are spawned from Empty Mesh helper, without geometry, usually linked to Source Mesh and Guide Curve Guide Curve curve object that guides strands Empty Curve helper, without geometry, (usually linked to Source Mesh and Guide Curve) Hair system transfer possibilities: Current Owner Transfer To Result Guide Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Guide Curve Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to new, empty mesh object Empty Curve Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Surface (usually scalp) Base Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Base Mesh Empty Curve Hair System will be moved to Empty Curve Hair object Base Mesh Empty Mesh Hair System will be moved to Empty Mesh object Empty Mesh Guide Curve Hair System will be moved to Guide Curve Empty Mesh Base Mesh Hair System will be moved to Base Mesh Visually there should not be any difference, except Hair System 'owner' will change User cases when you want to use Transfer Hair System: if you want to convert Hair System to mesh, but it is assigned to Curve (Curves do not support converting to mesh). In that case you can transfer Hair System to Empty Mesh, and then convert it to mesh if you want to 'Bake' curves generated by Hair System to curve, but it is assigned to Mesh (meshes cannot receive curves geometry). In that case you can transfer Hair System to Empty Curve, and then bake it to it if hair interpolation is broken (e.g. stops working after you select and try to sculpt Guide Curve. See note in Hair Iterpolation section Note : Often you may end up with Hair System assigned to Source Mesh Above Hair System was assigned to Guide Curve. Transfer Hair System operator will move Hair System to Base Mesh (or Empty Mesh). Convert to mesh will work now General Operations \u00b6 Remove whole Hair System - removes all Hair Systems, Setup and Profile modifiers from object Update All Hair System nodes - will replace all Hair Systems (including Profile and Setup modifiers), with the newest version - useful after updating Hair Tool Update Setup Node - will update Setup modifier only Bake To Curves - will bake Hair System to curves (if possible) Mesh from UV Holder - will bake Hair System uv regions/boxes to mesh(es). Can be used as Mesh Profile UVs Menu - copy and paste UVs from/to Hair System Strands Selection \u00b6 Selection Groups \u00b6 With Selection Groups you can manage strands selection - assign selected strands to new (or existing) groups, and then re-select them later. This is useful when making hairstyle with split, as you can select and work on each sided of head independently. Your browser does not support the video tag. Selection Groups - can be created using 'Assign New ID'. To re-select these strands later use 'Select Group' button and then picking hair strands using (Shift+) LMB Note : If you want assign hair clump to existing group use Assign Id: [x] - where [x] is Active Group number Your browser does not support the video tag. Selection Group From Island - it will create and assign hair strands selection groups based on island from which the strand originated Selection By Island \u00b6 If your source surface (usually scalp), is split into multiple islands, you can select hair strands that are originating from given island. This is useful when you want to select hair strands that are on specific part of the head (like top of the head, or back of the head) Your browser does not support the video tag. Select Island - will select hair strands that are originating from picked mesh island Note : instead of splitting the edges physically, you can use the Edges split modifier Helpers (un)Hide \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can also use Hotkeys: H key - will hide hair strands Alt+H - will reveal hidden strands Strands Generator and Filter \u00b6 After adding Hair System you will notice first slot in deformers stack is added automatically. It acts in binary way: Strands Generator \u00b6 Generator - will generate strands from Base Surface at given resolution, density, length etc. with interpolation option (Parent/Guide Tag must be set). These strands are affected by all subsequent deformers in current system stack Your browser does not support the video tag. Strands Generator - if parent tag is set, then strands will follow guide curves. Set as child Strands Filter \u00b6 Imagine you want to modify multiple Hair System, for example by adding Set Radius or Align Tilt etc. Rather than adding these deformers to each Hair System, one by one, you can use Filter System, to affect all filtered strands at once . Strands Filter is very useful, if placed at the end of stack - you can modify all preceding Hair Systems in one place . Note : If no filter tag is specified, then all strands will be affected Your browser does not support the video tag. In this simple demo we use 'Right' tag, to scale filtered strands Note : If you want to affect only part of visible hair you can enable ' Affect Tag ' option - and type int Tag of hairstrands that you want to modify. Child - Parent setup \u00b6 Tags can be used to setup child-parent relation between two Hair Systems. This unlocks: clumping, interpolation, curls, braids, twist and some other possibilities. Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above tag first Hair system with P_TAG , and set it as parent of 'Child' Hair System. Interpolation, clumping and other child deformers can be used now Hair Interpolation \u00b6 To enable hair interpolation, current Hair System has to have parent - see above . After that Toggle Interpolation button will be accessible (enabled by default) in first deformer - Strands Generator properties Note : In some cases interpolation may behave erratically (e.g interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). The most likely cause is - cyclic dependency: - Guide curve depends on your base mesh (usually scalp), - Base Mesh (with Hair System attached) depends on guide curve (through enabled interpolation to Parent - Guide Curve). To fix it and break the cyclic dependency use Transfer Hair System and move Hair System to either Empty Mesh or Guide Curve. Since Hair Tool 2.46 hair strands interpolation works in the area enveloped by loose mesh islands - meaning, if you want to make hairstyle with split: split scalp mesh in two, without separating to new object, (e.g. select edge loop, that divides the scalp in half - and press 'V' to rip it). Now child strands will not cross this edge. Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above I have cut mesh in 4 parts (visualised with 4 colors). Strands won't cross islands boundaries Note : If you want to make hairstyle with split, you can use Select By Island to select guide strands from specific island Note : instead of splitting the edges physically, you can use the Edges split modifier Hair System Copy/Paste \u00b6 You can copy settings from any hair system, and paste to target using entries above. Pasting Hair System settings (or instancing object that uses Hair System), will create linked copy. This means that any change on new copy, will affect original Hair System too. Number of Hair System users is displayed next to Hair Tag (green box above). Note: You can unlink Hair System, by clicking on 'users number' (see green box above) Tags \u00b6 You can think of Tags as labels assigned to Hair System strands. With Tags you can set child-parent relations or modify filtered strands with deformers . Why don't we just use system name - rather than introducing new feature? The difference is you can assign multiple tags to same strand e.g.: System A: LONG and CURLY . System B: LONG Now you can modify LONG tag without having to repeat same operations on system A and B twice. In addition, Tags can be assigned to subset of strands from within Hair System: you can use vertex group to select right half of hair strands and tag them as CURLY . Later you can modify only this tag or use it as parent. In image above we assigned A tag to 'First' Hair System. Guide curves have GUIDE tag - assigned automatically You can assign Tag in two ways: by typing it in next to system name see A tag in image above. If not tag was assigned then [TAG] label is shown by using Assign Tag deformer you can also assign tags to Hair System guide object (new Curve Hair) using Tags Panel . See Below Tags Panel \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In video above we create Tag A , then assign selected curves to tag A using Assign button Note : Assigning Tags only works on new Hair Curves. To be able to select individual curves, like in video above, you have to use Hair Modeling mode . For now only selection works from all the available Modeling Tools Hair Deformers \u00b6 Deformers gives you ability change chair look - add noise to hair, make them curl, snap to surface etc. They are stacked one on top of each other in similar way than Blender modifiers. They can be reordered. Some deformers (e.g. clump, twist, braids) will only work, if Hair System, to which deformers belong to is Set as Child Braids (Child) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Clump child strands to Guide/Parent strands (FIRST tag) in shape of Braids. Set Hair System as child first Clumps (Child) \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Scale hair up or down. With trim deformer we can reduce length of hair, but Scale deformer helps to make them longer. Slide Points \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Give more resolution to hair root or tips (depending on 'Influence Range'), by 'sliding' points along the curves Tag \u00b6 Assign Tag \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Here we assign R tag to right side of head (using vertex group). Then in following 'Scale' Hair System we can reffer to this tag using Strands Filter -> Affect Tag. This way only right side is affected (Scaled) Note : Assigning any tag e.g. X will create negative tag 'X, for example if we create tag RIGHT with some strands, then tag 'RIGHT will contain opposite set of strands. Delete Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Simple delete strands operation based on their Tag. In video above I removed strands tagged as R then GUIDE strands (bit hard too see, since they are covered by other strands) Tilt \u00b6 Add Tilt \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag.

Track to Mesh - Strands from closes mesh island will follow tracked mesh object. Use Bind button to prevets hair tips from 'sliding' on mesh surface Note : Closest affected island is determined by Tracked object origin. Move it to change which island will be affected. After finding desired island, you can move tracked object in edit mode, so that affected strands won't change. Note : If you want to 'Freeze' tracked points, use 'Bind Tracked Mesh' button. Now strands will follow point at which they were bound, rather than sliding around mesh surface. Track to Curve \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Track to Curve - Strands from closes mesh island will follow tracked curve object. Use Bind button to prevets hair tips from 'sliding' on tracked surface surface Note : Closest affected island is determined by Tracked object origin. Move it to change which island will be affected. After finding desired island, you can move tracked object in edit mode, so that affected strands won't change. Note : If you want to 'Freeze' tracked points, use 'Bind Tracked Curve' button (this will convert 'old' curve to 'new' type). Now strands will follow point at which they were bound, rather than sliding around curve surface. Trim \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. It will shorten strands roots and/or tips. Best to use with randomization mask Twist \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Twist effect requires to set Hair System to be set as child . For best effect is is good idea to place it after Clump deformer UV Region Set \u00b6 It is created automatically when Assigning UV Regions . Add multiple 'UV Region Set' deformers, if you want to achieve layered UVs. Input Masks \u00b6 You can mask most of the hair deformers inputs with various kind of effects. Multiple masks can be added. Note : The order matters: first top mask is evaluated then next to the bottom Your browser does not support the video tag. To add mask click drop down menu icon on right and pick mask type Vertex Group/Texture \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Vertex Group/Texture : Use vertex group or texture for input masking* Offset/Gain \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Mask Offset Gain : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it can increase the mask contrast (gain) or brightness (offset)* Invert \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Invert : Not useful by itself, but placed after another mask, it will invert the previous mask effect Randomize \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Randomize : Outputs random value for each strand. Random value will be picked from within [x-RandRange; x+RandRange] bounds, where x - is any input value - e.g. from vertex group mask You can disable lower/upper bound using < / > buttons, thus limiting Random value range. Rand Range - 0 - no randomization; 1 - maximum randomization Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly smaller values, from within given range, Variance == 0.5 all random values are drawn uniformly, from within given range, Variance < 0.5 outputs mostly bigger values, from within given range, Use Parent IDs - if enabled each child strand will inherit random value from its closest parent. Length Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Assigns Min value to the shortest strands, Assigns Max value to the longest strands. Swapping Min and Max values will invert the effect Procedural Mask \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Procedural Mask : Use procedural noise texture to randomize hair look. No need for UVs Min, Max - bring these values closer together to get sharper noise transition, Scale - the bigger scale the more detailed the texture will be, Distort - distorts the noise, Offset - offset the noise sampling position Influence Range \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Special mask that allows to modulate influence of deformer over strand length (e.g. taper only tip of strand). 0 - no effect, 1 - maximum effect Types of Influence range masks: Constant - the effect is uniform along the whole strand length Simple - gradually changes the influence from 0 to 100%. Influence can be flipped using invert button Quadratic - gives more detailed control: modulate effect independently at strand beginning, center and end Profile Curve - most detailed control using profile curve Defining Uvs \u00b6 Defining UVs \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Hair Uvs button works same way as for any other hair object. You can click and drag to define multiple UV regions. Since HTool 2.44 you can define multiple UVs regions (previously only one UV Region was supported) Make sure Hair System has material assigned in 'Profile' properties (or use Import Default Material ) Material UVs are outputted by 'Offset Node' - without it UVs won't work. After converting Hair System to mesh, you can use 'normal' mesh uvs (Offset node is not required) Hair System does not use multiple materials hack like we had to do for 'old' Curves 'Hair UV' operator will automatically add UV Region Set Deformer (see below) if it does not yet exist. Assigning UV Regions \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. You can use multiple 'Set UV Regions' Deformers, and stack them on top of each other (think of them as layers). In video above, I used 2nd Region (green) as base layer, then added 0th Region (purple) on top - masked by vertex group You can also use Set UV Region , and it will automatically create new 'UV Region Set' Deformer (or use active one if selected in Deformer Stack) If not UVs were assigned to current Hair System object, then running 'Set UV Regions' operator will add default UVs (with single UV box/region) Hair Profiles \u00b6 Hair Strands generated by Hair System, are then processed by Hair Profile system - it will add geometry to each strand, based on selected profile type. Most of these profiles types support UV mapping, so you can use textures to control hair look. Your browser does not support the video tag. Presentation of hair profiles available for Hair System No Profile - useful for build-in Blender curve Hair rendering (controlled in 'Curves' Panel in Cycles/Eevee Render Settings) Round Profile - used in Hair Tool baking setup Mesh Profile - replace hair strands with mesh (or collection of meshes) - e.g. you can instance feathers on hair Curve Profile - (with UV's) - any curve object can be used as custom hair profile Flat Profile - (with UV's) - AKA haircards, Circle Profile - (with UV's) - same as above, but it will generate cylinders Braid Profile - (with UV's) - generate procedural braids on each haircard Braid Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In demo above you can see both curve taper and tilt is affecting the generated braids shape Frequency - how dense braid interlacing is Main Radius - overall braid size Profile Radius - individual strands size (relative to Main Radius) Braid Resolution Factor - how many points should be generated for each period on braid (higher == smoother look) Radius Slide - The smaller the radius of guide curve, the more dense the braid becomes. Helps to give uniform look, when guide hair tapers Curls Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Curls Profile solves the issue of Curls Deformer - it has perfect aligning of haircard to center of guide curve (new in HTool 2.44) Frequency - how 'dense' curls are Amplitude - overall curls size Width - hair-card width Gravity - Curls get tenser at the endings Influence Range - Blend between straight strand and curl over strand length Influence Width - control the strand width over its length Mesh Profile \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. In this case I used Collection with 3 objects, to instance them along hair strands Mesh profile objects should point up, and theirs origin be at the bottom. Otherwise, they may not align correctly to hair strands. Their length is not normalized, meaning taller objects will be longer after placing on hair strands (you may need to match profile objects height by hand, to give them same length). Width - changes cross-section size of mesh when its is placed on top of curve Slice Mesh Profile button will cut object using custom 'slicing' modifier. This way it will conform better to hair splines - only. Button is displayed next to Profile dropdown menu '\u2713' Note : Slice Mesh Profile is using boolean operation in background. It may fail on more complicated objects - e.g. when mesh has self intersections. UV's of mesh profile objects will be preserved when instanced on top of hair. Using multiple copies of same objects with different UVs is a good way to add some randomization to hair look. Utils \u00b6 This section contains operators that are useful for Hair System workflow. Generate Attributes \u00b6 Generate extra attributes like: Tangent - required for proper specular highlights (only if you use Hair Tool hair material) Factor - black and white gradient along each strand length Random - each haircard will get random grayscale color Sample UV - pick name of UV channel, that you want transfer from Source Surface mesh to strands. This attribute can be then accessed in Hair Material using Attribute Node with name SampledUV Sample Color - pick name of vertex Color that you want transfer from Source Surface mesh to strands. This attribute can be then accessed in Hair material using Attribute Node with name SampledColor Above we sample 'UVMap' from sphere. This generates attribute named 'SampledUV', which can be used to color strands the same way as character body (sphere) Simplify Strands \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. Simplify Strands optimizes polycount of generated hair geometry, by assigning less points to shorter strands. This can easily cut polycount in half! Draw Source Mesh \u00b6 Your browser does not support the video tag. If Hair System is attached to source surface (scalp mesh in demo above), you can toggle drawing of this surface Updating \u00b6 After updating Hair Tool add-on, you may need to update your Hair Setup: There is option to update Individual Hair System elements (Deformers, Masks, Profiles etc.) - located in Deformers dropdown menu Setup and Profile node (green and blue box on image below) Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene. Be warned though: add-on will try to recreate whole node tree structure from scratch, so this may now always work. You may update deformer, profile, mask etc. nodes using menu above Note :: Using individual node packs update (only Deformers, or only Masks etc.) method is usually safer. Limitations \u00b6 Only One UV box can be assigned to profile - you can use Mesh Profile with multiple meshes as a workaround for randomizing UVs (No longer the case Since HT 2.44) Hair Modeling Tools do not work (except selection) Hair interpolation is using booleans under the hood. Because of this, interpolation may fail if boolean fails. And Interpolation may be slow on heavy base meshes (I recommend using lowpoly hair surface meshes). Hopefully I will find better way in the future, to create interpolations. (No longer the case since Blender 3.5 and Hair Tool 2.44) FAQ \u00b6 I get Errors in console \u00b6 If you open old blend file with old Hair Tool setup, after you updated Hair Tool, you may get some errors, and UI wont be drawn correctly. Use Update Whole Hair System located in General Menu - this will update all nodes, in all Hair Systems for all objects on scene Warning this is potentially destructive operation, since whole node tree will be recreated from scratch. Updated nodes behavior may change, resulting in slightly different hair look Cannot convert Hair System \u00b6 If you can't convert Hair System to mesh, then it is most likely, because Hair System is assigned Hair Curve object. Curves do not support converting to mesh operation. Use Transfer Hair System to move Hair System from Curve to Mesh. Then conversion to mesh Hair Cards will work Hair Interpolation won't work \u00b6 In some cases interpolation may behave erratically (e.g interpolation breaks when you select Guide Curve). The most likely cause is - cyclic dependency between Base Mesh with attached Hair System and Guide Curve. See note in Hair Iterpolation section. To fix the cyclic dependency use Transfer Hair System and move Hair System to either: Empty Mesh or Guide Curve. Note : If you use Blender below 3.5 , then Hair Tool used boolean operation/hack to interpolate hair strands. This may fail on some meshes (eg. nonclosed planar surfaces). In Blender 3.5 and above, Hair Tool uses new method, which is more robust, and will always work on any mesh. I recommend updating Blender to ver. 3.5.1, and then updating the node setup responsible for interpolation using this button:","title":"Hair System"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#hair-system","text":"Note : Available since Blender 3.0, requires Blender 3.3 or above","title":"Hair System"},{"location":"main_workflows/hair_system/#overview","text":"Hair System will help you generate procedural hair-cards in non-destructive way, based on Blender Geometry Nodes.

In this modeling technique we are instancing haircards on mesh edges (haircard count will be the same as character mesh edges count). Useful for creation of fur. Note Short Hair modeling requires Blender 3.3 or above. The main advantages: easy to setup - one click solution easy to tweak with blender sculpting tools (or with poly modeling) haircards distribution based on source character mesh topology - you will automatically get denser hair in more important areas: head, hands (but this can be con - depending on situation) The main cons: no easy way to control density - since density is based on source character mesh topology (you cant drive it with e.g. vertex group) hair source mesh has to have same topology as hair guide mesh. This mean you may have to start combing from scratch if change base mesh topology (but there is workaround I will show later) Note : You can tweak haircards density by changing base mesh topology - eg. by using remesh modifier or adaptive tessellation in blender sculpt mode. How To use \u00b6 Select your character. Let's assume it is named: Body Use Ctrl+Shift+H menu -> 'Setup Short Hair' Alternatively you can use: right sidebar (N key) -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel -> 'Setup Short Hair' Two new objects will be added: Body_short_hair (hair object) and Body_hair_guide (drawn as bounding box) Select hair guide object (bounding box) and go into sculpt mode that is it, you can now sculpt hair by sculpting guide mesh (polygonal modeling can be used too) Note To finalize Short hair use 'Convert Short Hair to Mesh' from Hair Tool Ctrl+Shift+H menu. This will correctly tranfser UVs from modifier to mesh data Remeshing Modes: \u00b6 When you use 'Setup Short Hair' operator, you will have option to remesh base geometry (or leave it as it is). Since haircards are spawned on each mesh edge, then source mesh topology has big influence on Short Hair look Three main modes of remeshing starting from left: Diamonds, Triangulated Diamonds, Triangulated Cells Base Suzanne is made from around 1000 edges. Meaning Short Hair will spawn 1000 haircards (planes or ribbons) Diamond Topology will create 2000 edges Diamond Triangulated will create 3000 edges Triangulated Cells will output 4600 edges! Cells remeshing - gives highest poly-count but the resulting topology is organic and thanks to this haircards will also be distributed in natural way. Diamonds topology, on the other hand, has visible repeating pattern and it may show through on generated haircards. Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh Defining UVs \u00b6 UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs. Select Short Hair object open UV Image Editor and press \u2018Hair UV\u2019 button located in top header bar - on far right then draw UV boxes like it is shown in Defining UVs . The only difference, compared to curves, is that UV mirroring is automatically enabled. Uv Region defined above can be distributed/assigned to hair-cards in two ways - using Vertex Groups as UV mask, or manually. Manual UV assignment \u00b6 You can manually select mesh parts and assign uv regions to it Set UV Region : Select Short Hair object, and go into Edit Mode (using Tab key) Select edges for which you want to assign new UV regions Use Ctrl + Shift + H menu -> Set UV Region , and pick UVs that you want to assign to selection. Short Hair Cards generated at these edges will receive new UVs. Set UVs using Vertex Groups \u00b6 Semi-automatic way of assigning UVs using Vertex groups (access from right Sidebar -> Hair Tool Tab -> Short Hair panel) We have [L]eft and [R]ight vertex groups. We can use these to assign different UV regions With above setup, UV_1 region will be assigned to hair-cards on [L]eft, and UV_2 region on [R]ight Note : First entry (Base UV) in vert Group layers is always used as 'Background' layer - meaning UV regions assigned to it, will be distributed on whole character body.

Triangulation of Diamonds helps slightly, but it is not as good as Cells Topology Note 1 : If you want denser haircards you can add subdivision modifier to your base mesh, but resulting edges count will quadruple Note 2 : I did not test it, but using Dynotopo topology from sculpt mode may actually be nice way to get organic and controllable mesh","title":"Remeshing Modes:"},{"location":"main_workflows/short_hair/#defining-uvs","text":"UV workflow for Short Hair is similar to Curve UVs.

You can change Short Hair parameters by going into modifiers tab. Use Guide Object - You may want to use the modifier without Hair Guide object. This boolean parameter helps to turn off Guide object, without breaking modifier behavior Your browser does not support the video tag. Guide Object - Haircards will follow Guide Object deformations. It does not matter if you modify Deformer object in sculpt mode or in Edit mode, but you can't change Deformer object topology . Deformer object topology has to be the same as base hair object, but shape can (and should) be different. In video above all modification performed on Deformer object are stored in Shape Key - this gives you more control on the shape of the mesh in non destructive way Your browser does not support the video tag. Strand Resolution - Add additional subdivision along strands length Your browser does not support the video tag. Placement Mask - select vertex group to mask the Short Hair effect Your browser does not support the video tag. Puff - Push hair outside of surface. Helps to draw haircards when guide mesh is exactly the same as base mesh, thus haircards would have zero length and they would be invisible Your browser does not support the video tag. Bend Factor - Make strands straight (0) or bent (1). Works only when segments count is bigger than 1 Your browser does not support the video tag. Bend Shape - Bending is happening mostly on roots (0) or at tips (1) of hairstrands.
